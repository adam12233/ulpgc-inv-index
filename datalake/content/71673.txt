i will not attempt to describe my agitationsin order to relieve
these emotions continued he i will ease your suspence i have seen a
person who has brought me intelligence of duncan a stranger was
introduced to me at a coffeehouse last night as wanting to know and
speak to me he announced himself as the supercargo of a dutch ship
now in the thames and said that he was charged with a commission for
me by a gentleman whom he had known at surinam i instantly ordered a
private room and he informed me that he had first seen duncan at
amsterdam had there learned enough of his story to pity him and that
he made the voyage to surinam with him his unfortunate condition and
deep dejection during our passage added this man more and more
interested my feelings for one whose education and manners had promised
a very different career i was happily disposed to befriend him and as
fortunately i had the means of so doing for i recommended him to a
merchant there who received him into his counting house but the fever
of the climate seized him before he had been a fortnight on shore he
saw his danger and had as it appears been preparing for it he gave
into my hands the picture of a young lady which he wore in his bosom
with a parcel in which he informed me was contained some letters of the
ladys with one for you he conjured me to deliver these to you in
person knowing that our ship was bound to this port on her return i
promised to observe his instructions and i have only further to add
sir that knowing as i do the love he cherished for the lady whom he
blessed with his last breath i think it right to hint to you some
precautions in acquainting her with my poor friends death you may
suppose i satisfied him on this point continued my brother and i
endeavoured to sift out of him whether he knew the whole of duncans
adventures and secrets it was an unhappy business observed i that
obliged this unfortunate young man to quit england and his friends who
were able and not indisposed to serve him had he not been too
precipitate his flight was nearly the death of the young woman in
question you surprise me by telling me that his attachment for her
continued did he often speak of her never replied he nor do i
even know her name or address when in nearly his last hour he gave me
her picture from his bosom and said mr flamall knows for whom it is
destined he will take care to tell the unfortunate injured object of my
love that charles duncan has expiated all his errors by dying and
leaving her freei said with seriousness that the most fatal of
duncans errors had been that of not knowing his best friend a mistake
however which had not been shared by the young lady whose heart he had
gained for that she still looked up to me for friendship and
consolation our conversation finished by settling our next meeting for
this morning i have just left him satisfied as i believe that duncan
had in me a friend as generous as himself there is your picture and
this packet of your letters with one for me which i have just received
from the gentleman i will leave it for your perusal when you are able
he quitted me unable to witness my distress my duncans letter i shall
copy


                              letter liv
                    charles duncan to mr flamall

before this reaches your hand i shall be numbered with those in the
grave and appear before that awful tribunal at which mercy has her
everlasting post there and there only does charles duncan expect to
find justice for then alone will his errors be weighed with his
difficulties enclosed is my will in which i have left to harriet
duncan my lawful wife the whole and entire property bequeathed to me
by margaret duncan my supposed mother and the only friend i ever knew
i have charged this my property with the payment of one hundred and
fifty pounds to mynheer adrian vandergucht my last benefactor this sum
has been partly advanced for my necessities he will with this produce
my acknowledgment for the receipt of one hundred pounds i bequeath to
him fifty as a debt of gratitude for kindnesses which none can fully
repay but his maker and to his blessing and mercy do i fervently
recommend him

from what mrs duncan repeatedly declared to me and also from your
conversations with me on the subject of my little fortune i conclude
that my wife will receive three thousand pounds as her future provision
it may be this pittance will be shared by my child let it be your
care sir faithfully to discharge a trust for the due performance of
which you will one day be called to a strict account by a being more to
be dreaded than


                               letter lv

my letter from my unfortunate charles contained these words

forget my beloved wife that charles duncan ever had existence or
that in the miserable course of that existence he has involved yours
in his misery blasted the hopes of your youth and planted daggers in
your faithful bosom forget if thou canst forget when pressing to thy
maternal bosom the fruit of thy illfated union the wandering
wretched father of thy babe or with pity and forgiveness think of him
as one at rest rescued from ignominy concealed from the cruel
mockery of scorn welcoming at this moment the approach of his
deliverer and looking forwards with humble hope to an eternity in
which he will be recompensed for the trials of his mortal state and
pardoned for those mistakes into which his youth and frailty betrayed
him i enclose the copy of my will with some of your dear letters with
these you will receive your picture but i cannot spare it from my
bosom whilst my trembling hand is able to raise it to my lips or do
more than sign the name of thy repentant yet faithful

a time was allowed me for my sorrow and recovery from a fever of much
danger but which was i believe of use to my general health for i
certainly was less liable to illness after this crisis i experienced
something of those sentiments which the dying duncan had suggested i
rejoiced that he was at peace and considered my fate as ascertained i
could not know more of grief than i had experienced and in a
submission which necessity and i hope also religion enforced i
settled into a calm and resigned frame of mind my extreme bodily
weakness favoured for a time this more placid condition of my spirits
and my recovery promised to my tender and assiduous brother a renewal
of his comforts he soon mentioned mr duncans donation he told me
that knowing as i did that both keith and his wife were dead he
thought it was much the most prudent measure to let the property remain
on the stock books as it had done from the time of mrs duncans
committing her money and her reputed son to his trust till such time
as he should become of age his quitting england within three or four
months of his being so continued my brother prevented any settlement
or transfer of the stock but he was mistaken in his opinion of his
fortune for it amounts to no more than two thousand pounds i answered
with sincerity that i regarded it whatever it might be as a common
fund and should leave to him the disposal of it as most useful to our
common comfort and being persuaded that i should not live long i
thought it could not be better than as it was he laughed at my
prophetic fears assuring me that the physician had told him i stood a
better chance of being well than when at kensington and he left me with
a cheerfulness which soothed me his attentions did not slacken he saw
with satisfaction my returning activity and frequently observed that i
was never more beautiful by degrees he prevailed on my reluctance to
visit and receive his friends and i as clearly discovered that my
brother wished to see me married as i manifested a repugnance to the
very idea of exchanging my condition for any other i thus attained my
twentythird year from this period the calmness of my mind was
disturbed by the change i perceived in my brothers modes of life with
anguish of soul i discovered that he was tired of having a sister
without ambition and a beauty as she was called on his hands who was
deaf to flattery and who scorned infamy however decorated i was
stiled a romantic idiot a cold and unempassioned statue proud of a
form that was daily becoming useless i became resolute and told him
that with any form i would endeavour to gain honest bread my spirit
silenced him he begged my pardon and pleaded his conviction that it
would be in my power to marry the libertine whom he had conditioned
with on easy terms though not less profitable to his views his fears
his regrets at seeing me waste my youth in unavailing sorrow his
belief that my lover would marry me at the death of an old grandfather
his wishes to do so secretly were placed before me i relented
though without yielding to his dishonourable views and all was again
peace between us but i no longer considered philip flamall as the
guardian of a sisters honour under this conviction i soon after saw
mr flint for the first time he came to the house as it appeared on
business and finding philip absent seemed desirous of waiting for his
expected return he was accordingly conducted to me as a client of too
much consequence to remain unnoticed in the office his age and
respectable appearance induced me to shew him every mark of respect i
recollected my fathers opinion of mr flint and his family and i tried
to please him by my attentions my guest contentedly maintained his post
till my brother returned at the dining hour fortunately we were alone
that day and mr flint who accepted at once of the invitation found
only a table at which economy presided i retired as soon as my office
was finished but i was told that he meant to breakfast with my brother
the next morning unconsciously i endeavoured to secure to philip this
wealthy client and as it will appear i succeeded


some days after my brother with much seriousness informed me that my
modest and composed deportment had pleased mr flint he has not only
made his proposals to me of jointuring you in four hundred pounds per
annum added he but he has also on hearing the precise state of my
fortune engaged to befriend me by lending me a sum of money which may
turn to good account he knew my father and he is no stranger to the
difficulties in which he left me involvedi attempted to speakhear
me to the end pursued he before you condemn a brother to a goal
this mans age his retired habits of life and his fair character in
the world for his uprightness renders him more an object of veneration
than of love you may recompense him for the protection of the parent
by the kind offices of the daughter whilst by the union he solicits
you are securing to yourself an honourable name and independence and
saving me from ruin for i tell you plainly that i am already in a
state of insolvency in regard to credit i will have you to consider of
the answer you will commission me to give mr flint it is not
necessary to deliberate replied i weeping bitterly the knowledge of
my real situation will at once convince mr flint that i am not a
suitable companion for his children nor a becoming choice for him and
without adverting to the folly which has led him to think of marriage
it will be enough that he knows that i am duncans widow


never shall i forget my brothers fury be a fool to the last cried
he see me a beggar blast my character with your own sink me to a
level with your highwayrobber but know added he trembling that i
can be as desperate as your duncan i will not be an outlaw for one
purse can you be so weak as to think any man will marry you under the
name of duncan what has this miscreant to do with the present question
he is dead the witnesses of your accursed marriage are dead you have
persisted in bearing your own name and the character of an unmarried
woman oh harriet let me plead for your youth your helpless condition
of fortune for your innocence and for a brother who loves you marry
this worthy man and let me see you protected from the dangers of the
world i was subdued i forsook the path of rectitude and as harriet
flamall married mr flint who was three times my age




                               chap ii


we quitted london a few days after the ceremony was performed and i now
had leisure to repent of my weakness and timidity my introduction to my
husbands family was humiliating and painful to the last degree of
suffering sensibility i was not only an intruder but i was an
usurper of the rights i claimed and i felt that in my assumed title of
mrs flint was contained a reproach which covered me with confusion
every time i heard it pronounced my only consolation sprang from the
resolution of devoting my life to the man whom i had thus deceived he
was fond of me and i studied incessantly to make him contented with his
wife i foolishly began to think that i should contribute to the slender
stock of domestic comfort which i found at farefield hall mr percival
flint and his amiable sister mary appeared to treat me as one destined
to enlarge their and their fathers happiness even miss flint seemed
reconciled to the young motherinlaw who had in no instance
abridged her in her authority i was fond of flowers and already began
to enjoy the amusement of the garden mr percival one morning entered
my dressing room where lucretia and myself were at our needle work my
husband having taken his darling mary with him in his airing his hands
were filled with some rare and beautiful plants and i found that this
was a tribute to my peculiar taste my thanks followed and percival
withdrew in order to see the plants properly disposed of you have
converted observed miss flint with a malicious laugh our grave and
solemn bookworm into a useful being what a thousand pities it is that
percival had not seen you before his father as the business is now
managed he must remain the despairing shepherd for i think the public
cruelty prohibits the soninlaw from marrying the motherinlaw who in
many cases might console the poor widow my countenance marked how
little this levity pleased me dear me pursued she you need not
look so offended or be displeased with so harmless a joke you cannot
help percivals playing the fool nor prevent peoples thinking that
the father at seventy is not altogether so handsome as the son at
twentythree or four you might be tempted to acknowledge this truth
yourself were it not for this unlucky relationship you could not in
conscience deny that he is much better qualified to succeed mr
duncan than his fatheri heard no more for yielding to terror and
surprise i fainted and my successive fits alarmed the family and as i
supposed moved to pity the cruel insulter who had brought them on me
she was very assiduous and attentive to me during the few days of my
convalescence and with much humility begged my pardon saying that she
had never entertained the slightest suspicion prejudicial to me but
that having heard of a disappointment of a tender kind which for a time
had injured my health and spirits she frankly confessed that she had
attributed my choice of her father to that cause believing that no
woman with my beauty and at my age would prefer for an husband a man
old enough for her grandfather i neither intended to reproach you or
that choice nor to hurt your feelings by naming the gentleman in
question added she i simply wished to establish between us a
confidence and friendship which i conceived might be useful to us both
i have my secrets my dear harriet and my heart has suffered like your
own the pangs of unrequited nay abused love she proceeded to
inform me of mr howards perfidy who after having gained her
affections had voluntarily given himself up to the arts of her sister
who with a pretty face and the years of a child had basely supplanted
her in the opinion of a man whom she well knew was necessary to her
happiness and who had from her very cradle shown the greatest cunning
and address in rendering every one subservient to her will and she
warned me at the same time of her absolute power over my husband


subdued by conscience and uncertain of the extent of the information
which miss flint had gained with the knowledge of mr duncans name i
accepted of her apology and still further tutored by my brother
passively yielded to an authority with which i was unable to contend i
tamely witnessed the treatment which poor miss mary received from her
enraged and implacable sister and finally saw the innocent girl ruined
in her fathers love my husband was incensed by some letters of mr
howards which fell into lucretias hands these were incautiously
preserved by the fond girl and they were certainly such as mr howard
had done much more wisely not to have written i endeavoured to soften
my husbands resentment and i should have succeeded for he loved his
daughter mary even if i may be allowed to speak to a degree of
weakness and he was wretched because she was unhappy he spoke to my
brother on the subject and discovered an inclination to unity and
forgiveness requesting him to employ his influence with lucretia to
give up to a sister a man whom she could not win for herself adding
that notwithstanding mr howard had so highly offended him he would
pass over every thing for the sake of peace and to content poor mary
my brother instead of executing this commission sternly warned me to
take care of what i was doing were you any thing but what you are
said he you would perceive the danger of your interfering with this
virago let her alone in time you will see her your slave instead of
your tyrant trust not to the fondness of your husband you see what she
has effected with her father in regard to her sister judge of her power
by this proof of it and avoid offending her you will ruin yourself
and serve no one


i believe it is not useless to mention here that on my marriage taking
place my brother took his degree as barrister and quitting his house in
red lion square took apartments in lincolns inn fields whether his
former clients forgot him or he them i know not but so it was he
resided almost constantly at the hall and became useful to mr flint in
return for the hospitality he found confined principally to the care of
amusing and nursing my husband whose health rapidly declined under the
perpetual vexations he endured i could not help perceiving that my
influence was sedulously watched and every time he expressed the
regrets he experienced from being prevented seeing his child i was
suspected of having produced those relentings of nature in her favour
and was reproached by mr flamall for my folly in being blind to my own
interest and i was told that i had nothing to do but to attend to my
husband i perfectly understood this language and i did attend to my
husband but it was not to deceive or insult him he was too weak to
be advised by me and unhappily feeling at times the state of abject
slavery to which his own weakness had reduced him he vented his
resentments in peevish complaints and angry reproaches that i was too
passive and indifferent to defend him against his tormentor then
weeping like an infant he would beg me not to leave him for that i was
his only comfort


one day he mentioned the disposition he had made of his property
adding that his children would think of him when he was dead although
they had abandoned him whilst living as to you my poor harriet said
he i have taken care to leave you enough for your ambition though i
can never repay you for the loss of your health which will be destroyed
by your attendance on me you will find besides your jointure a legacy
of three thousand pounds with which you may settle yourself comfortably
when they send you from hence this sum is in your brothers hands and
he may perhaps recollect when you shew him the bond that he is in
arrears for the interest ever since your marriage he was a needy man
my harriet when i lent him the money and i warn you not to trust him
with your affairs when i am gone although he is your brother that
very evening he was seized with convulsions i pass over an interval of
suffering which was terminated by his death


i will not attempt to describe my astonishment on hearing the deceased
mr flints will read let it suffice that its contents were such as
astonished every one my name only appeared in it as having been
provided for at my marriage and as it was necessary to specify that the
jointure which had so provided for me was to revert to miss flint at my
decease on failure of issue i retired to my apartment overwhelmed with
grief and confusion mr and mrs howard might be said to have haunted
my imagination i had witnessed their distress on hearing this unjust
will read they were continually before me and innocent as i was i
felt my soul agonised by the internal conviction which pressed upon me
that all was not honourable yet a suspicion of my brother reached only
to another enigma what was become of the bond this question was on my
lips more than once but philip had succeeded in making himself more the
object of my dread than confidence to retire from the hall to assert
the independence which i had so dearly purchased to share with the
howards their fathers bounty were the purposes of my mind and its
support in the mean time i was treated with unusual respect and
attention by miss flint who repeatedly assured me that the object of
her fathers affections would always have claims on her own that she
could not bear to see me so depressed by an event which was to be
expected in the common course of nature and that if i thought i had not
been sufficiently considered for the sacrifices of health and pleasure
she was certain that her fathers omission resulted from his firm
persuasion that we should always share the same abode and domestic
comforts i blushed and replied that i had every reason to be
contented with mr flints generosity and affection had the provision
allotted me added i with more spirit been only a fourth part of what
it is i should have been satisfied for i seek only independence she
looked disappointed and changed the subject of conversation


my brother paid me a visit the following morning and having in vain
requested me to take an airing grew angry wherefore is it harriet
said he with a petulant air that you affect to play the ephesian
matron with me it is impossible you can regret the death of a doating
childish old man worn out by sufferings at seventy and upwards to
what purpose this seclusion this dejection these perpetual tears one
would imagine you had already been entombed long enough but there is no
remedy for a romantic mind continued he with more tenderness any
other woman but yourself would have resented his want of generosity you
are poorly recompensed my dear girl for your watching and for the
loss of your beauty i have enough for my wants answered i and
much more than i deserved i was not of that opinion replied he
and soon after your marriage gave mr flint to understand that i
thought his widow was but slenderly provided for unless further
considered he told me that he had thought as i did and had acted
accordingly he added that you were the only comfort he had in this
world that he had to thank me for the blessing and that i should find
he had not forgotten my kindness i have reason continued philip to
think that he kept his word and destroyed the bond he held against me
for it has not appeared i concealed my face in the sophacushion
otherwise he must have perceived my astonishment this consideration on
his part continued he has been however repaid on mine for i have
been useful to him in my professional way and never charged him
sixpence i sighed profoundlycome cried he assuming a more
cheerful air let us now look forward to more pleasing prospects you
may yet be mistress here


i was now told of his intrigue with miss flint of his unhappily being a
married man and of the worthlessness of his wife who exercised over
him an empire in all things save that of bearing his name in a word
miss flints critical situation was brought forward and my agency was
demanded as the only means of saving her fame and the infant from the
disgrace of an illegitimate birth i listened to this discourse with
disgust and even horror but suppressing my feelings i told him with
firmness that i had gone already too far into concealments not to
discover the danger of the road that i meant to quit the hall and had
already formed my plans for my future life these added i bursting
into tears will not nor can be subservient to your or miss flints
views you will change your mind replied he sternly when i tell
you that what you have refused to do from gratitude and affection to a
brother may be thought expedient to perform for your own safety miss
flint has known the particulars of your first marriage from the day you
appeared here as her fathers wife moreover she insists upon it that
you have no legal proofs of duncans death nor any claim to your
jointure from its having been granted under a name and character to
which you had no right you will do well to reflect on her temper and
on your condition under a prosecution for bigamy my evidence in
your favour amounts simply to the dutchmans verbal attestation of being
at duncans funeral and his letters and will written at surinam these
with me are conclusive proofs but i know not how far they would be so
thought in a court at doctors commons nor with what consequences at
the best your marrying when a widow under your maiden name may be
attendedmy punishment is just exclaimed i i will avow the truth
i will not take mr flints money i will go where i may mourn my lost
happiness and die i ask you only to provide me an asylum for the
moment i will not be a burden to youtenderness was next tried my
ruin involved his the fate of a child who though yet unborn was urged
with many tears miss flints generosity to me her attachment to him
were not omitted i was conquered do with me what you will said i
mournfully only remember philip who it was that spread the toils
with which my soul is encompassed i cannot live to see you miserable
he employed much sophistry to convince me that i was engaged in the
performance of a meritorious work inasmuch as it secured innocence from
shame and saved the reputation of mr flints daughter a woman who had
respected my secret and whose gratitude would bind her to me for life




                               chap iii


i will pass over the means of deceit and imposition now employed i
became a nominal mother to philip flint and the measures which had
been adopted by removing me to london in order for my confinement
appeared to have secured miss flints reputation thus betrayed by
others i had some palliations to offer to my upbraiding conscience the
innocent being i had adopted as my own pleaded still more powerfully i
loved him with a parents love and i sheltered him from unjust reproach
and scorn in this temper of mind i became acquainted with sir murdoch
maclairn alas in the society of truth and honour i was a dissembler
how often have i forgotten whilst listening to his tale of woe in
which all was faithfulness that i was a deceiver and whilst my
heart and tongue spoke his language that my life had been for months a
falsehood my affections now betrayed me i loved and i rashly hazarded
the peace and the honour of the man for whom i would have died i became
his wife and to his noble heart do i appeal he has found me his
faithful wife may i not say yet more if to have emulated sir
murdoch maclairn in his virtues if to have loved him supremely if to
have known no joy in which he has not shared if to have shared with
courage his sorrows which were aggravated to me by the bitter
conviction that i alone deserved to be wretched if to have thus acted
is to be a wife then will sir murdoch maclairn pronounce me his
faithful though erring wife witness for me my beloved son to my
malcolm do i appeal to my support my only hope in this world you have
seen your mothers conflicts you have shared in her sorrows witness
for me that i have lived for no other purpose but to soothe to watch
to sustain the father whom you love and venerate one incident which
occurred in your early life must be mentioned here you are no stranger
my son to the difficulties we had to surmount in consequence of your
fathers resolution to leave the hall and to reside in france i have
frequently lamented before you this period of my life we had however
so far conquered the opposition to our removal the time was fixed for
our journey and even our trunks were preparing miss flint saw these
preparations with unfeigned grief for let me be just she knew me and
she loved me i left your dear father busily engaged in examining some
papers contained in a cabinet which had been recently sent him from
scotland and with my work bag sought the dejected lucretia she was
alone in the bow parlour and weeping i was employed in consoling her
by those arguments which had been a thousand times repeated when
philip your uncle entered and sullenly took up a book without
noticing me in a few minutes after your father entered the room and
with a placid air said i have brought you something to see and
admire and placing a small ebony box richly inlaid with silver on the
table before us he succeeded in exciting our curiosity the casket is
nothing to its contents said he smiling at our admiration of the box
and taking from it a shagreen picturecase which he opened what say
you to this portrait said he shewing us a pretty large miniature of a
gentleman in a spanish habit did you ever see a more manly gracious
countenance we examined it and to the praise due to the artist and
the noble lineaments he had preserved was added our admiration of the
rich diamonds which encircled it it ought to have a companion
observed your father taking up another shagreen case similar to the
one before us but it might have been as well if the picture of the lady
had never reached my hand for harriet may be jealous of its superlative
beauty he added that the story of the lovers was long and disastrous
and might be the ground work of a tragedy not unlike in many particulars
to the fatal marriage i remember continued he that when my
father many years since shewed me the two pictures he briefly mentioned
some circumstances which touched me to the soul he was the friend
intrusted with these portraits and with the care of seeking out an
infant son who had been conveyed from madrid when no more than three
days old and who had unaccountably eluded all the enquiries which my
father had at that time been able to make my absence from scotland
and my fathers death with other events he sighedobliterated from my
memory this box and the particulars i have mentioned about a month
since it was sent me having been deposited by my father previously to
his death in the hands of a minister of the kirk of scotland he on his
deathbed sent it to me with many injunctions to be careful of it
amongst several letters written in spanish from which i can only
discover the writers to be of high rank i found also a deposition made
by my father and addressed to myself he informs me that having
traced as he believes the invaluable child of his noble friends he
had sent his mothers picture to the faithful woman who had been the
only person privy to his birth and who passed for his mother this i
was instructed to do added my father and the test of the boys
identity rested on the womans returning the picture with the name of
her lady annexed to it she received it from faithful hands for i was
already on that bed of death from which i am permitted to write this
she said she should write to me from london having in her turn
instructions to follow and that with the witnesses of her integrity she
should present herself before me with her precious charge and with
transports of joy make over to my care a youth worthy of the duke and
dutchess she signed herself s duncan philip advanced to the table he
examined the picture attentively does your romance finish here
asked he so it appears replied my husband otherwise that picture
and the letters would have been reclaimed i should think no one will
at present be found to claim them observed mr flamall i fear so
also answered sir murdoch but when i am on the continent i shall
lose no opportunity of giving up my important trust to the family i
would be dd cried my brother laughing if i went a league out of my
road on such an errand perhaps not answered my husband coldly you
may not think it necessary he folded up the portrait and replacing
it withdrew what a pity it is cried flamall as he followed him
with his eye that maclairn is not a spanish grandee his gravity would
have suited admirably with their dignity and his honour with their
pride some people and honest ones too would think the diamonds at
least a lawful prize in this case and without a doubt they have long
been considered as lost they would pay for your journey harriet or
usefully decorate the poor baronets lady i made no answer for i
was nearly fainting with emotion and surprise but finding miss flint
well disposed to reply for me i left the room and retreated from the
scene of altercation which ensued and which was but too familiar to my
ears your fathers illness succeeded to this occurrence my dear
malcolm i will hasten to inform you and him of the reasons which led
me to give this incident a place in my narrative


it is now something more than five years since that i was called upon
to feel the full weight of the penalty affixed by eternal justice to
the violation of truth and rectitude of conduct in the duties before
me the remembrance of the unfortunate duncan had been softened down
into the placid hope of his being at peace miss flint had apparently
forgotten that such a being had ever existed a more immediate concern
engaged her mind and from her excessive fondness of her son grew up a
dislike to you and a jealousy of your mother which harassed me and
rendered her unhappy several circumstances which i need not recall to
your memory proved to her that the slave of mr flamall and her own
sheltered dependent was not without the animal instinct of defending
her offspring and even in these contests the name of duncan never
escaped her lips this generosity was not lost upon me who had to
sustain the cruel and barbarous hints not unfrequently dropped by my
brother in regard to a subject too painful to be enlarged upon and
which produced no other effect than that of making me more and more
the inmate of your fathers apartment

i had as usual seen my beloved patient quietly tasting that repose
which his agitated mind required and i left him to take my accustomed
walk in the avenue a radiant moon with the soft evening breeze which
had succeeded to a sultry day cheered me and i sauntered until you met
me on your return from your friends at the farm we enjoyed the scene
around us and for some time conversed at our ease on the seat round
the oak but hearing the turret clock chiming the three quarters after
ten i rose to return to the house when suddenly a wretched looking
man sprang from the covert near us and ran with swiftness down the
avenue you instantly dissipated my alarm by telling me it was a sick
sailor whom you had met and relieved that afternoon on your way to mr
wilsons he had it appeared been shipwrecked and was begging his way
to his friends in london you finished your little story by adding
that you supposed he had strolled into the avenue and had fallen
asleep we parted for the night and i thought no more of the mendicant
sailor the following evening i again repaired to the avenue it was
about eight oclock and again i took my seat at the oak again did i
see this miserable object slowly advancing towards me his ghastly
countenance excited my compassion not my fears and i rose to meet him
with some silver in my hand he stopped leaning himself against a tree
and wiping his face as though faint with hunger gazed upon me do not
advance cried i quickening my pace honest friend i am coming to
give you a trifle he groaned dropped a sealed packet and darted from
me with speed


terrors too powerful for language assailed me i gasped for breath and
for some minutes stood motionless gazing at the fleet and dreadful
spectre for such he seemed at the stile he turned and from its
elevation still saw me he struck his breast and head then vanished a
sudden conviction shot through my confounded senses i seized the
parcel it was addressed to lady maclairn and in the well remembered
characters of charles duncan i placed it in my bosom and was i
believe indebted to the air for the preservation of life for i did not
faint although unconscious of time your cheerful voice malcolm as
you approached me singing roused me and i attempted to rise but again
i sunk on the seat i had quitted and burst into tears you saw my
emotion my dear son and in reply to your enquiries i made the usual
answer for the dejection of my spirits adding that i had again seen
the vagabond in the avenue at a distance and not chusing to advance
had kept near the house not altogether without fear i met him
returned you and told him that he was trespassing and that he must
not be seen in the avenue he said he hoped he should be many miles
from it in twentyfour hours meaning to pursue his route before
sunrise the next morning he begged my pardon he had been induced to
seek the relief his miseries needed but finding the lady was alarmed
had retreated i commended him for his attention and rewarded him with
some silver he has done me no harm replied i for i was not much
disposed to ramble feeling languid before i left the house i was no
sooner arrived there than i retired to my room and with agonies which
it is beyond my power to describe i read as follows


                         to lady maclairn

the poor the outraged the vilified charles duncan lives to proclaim
his wrongs to pour forth his sorrows before the only being on earth who
will pity him he lives to redeem his honour from the disgrace and
eternal infamy of having deserted the woman whom in the presence of
his maker he vowed to cherish and protect he lives to take vengeance
on his oppressors he lives to behold thee once more and then death
will close his account here the grave will be his bed of repose heaven
will in its own time explain to him wherefore he existed and to what
purpose he has suffered


i am composed my harriet i have seen thee i have heard thy gentle
voice listened in breathless silence to the pure effusions of thy
spotless mind heard my harriet my wife my all that heaven has given
me speak to her son praise his filial duty to his father heard
that that parent had been smitten stricken by the hand of adversity
heard her call him her dear maclairn her helpless her unfortunate
husband was this the language to heal my broken spirit no but it was
that which has fettered every tumultuous passion of my soul i would not
for worlds speak to you harriet i would not for worlds approach you
no i would refuse your offered love what brand with infamy thy
spotless name sink the honourable wife the virtuous mother to be the
sharer of my wretched condition the companion of a reputed robber a
worthless vagabond of a being who can claim no affinity but to the
earth he treads no harriet thy duncan is not yet so poor so abject
scorned and sunk as he may be in your eyes he yet proudly maintains
his claims to the recompense of long suffering and patience this is not
duncans theatre of glory but he has before him an inheritance and a
home and he has only to press forward to attain it

the wife of sir murdoch maclairn the mother of his children the prop
and comfort of his life is in my eyes encompassed by an host of angels
shall the wretched duncan invade the blessings of another no harriet
he has beheld you for the last time live and die a suitable inhabitant
for a better world live to be reverenced by your childrens children
live to be called the matrons pride and your sexs boast only think
of me as a man who was once thy love as one incapable of forgetting
you think of me as one who would sooner have been what he has been
cruelly believed to be than have basely left thee to the tortures of
doubt and suspense and abandoned to an insulting world think of me
only as an unfortunate man as one whom you may pity as one who will
soon be removed as one whose heart

again i take up my pen again the tumult of my senses is calmed i can
now weep i can thank god that your brother is absent i can pray my
harriet i can see the god of mercy allaying the storm and smoothing my
passage to himself farewell i have only to see that you are in
possession of my justification and then shall seas again separate us
whilst my soul still fondly clings to thee farewell farewell

                                                       charles duncan

you have not forgotten the hour of our separation harriet you cannot
have obliterated from your memory my agonies on trusting to the winds
and waves my wife my hopes my all you cannot have forgotten my vows
of love of fidelity of truth what must have been the artifices the
machinations employed to beguile you of your confidence in charles
duncan but have i not before me an evidence of that subtle mischief
which man when lost to all that is manly can effect was thy innocence
a match for villany thy weakness an armour against cruelty what have
not been the means employed to ruin thee as well as myself oh being
of infinite justice to thee do i look up for a solution of all my
doubts let me still hold fast my only consolation my harriet my wife
stands blameless in thy sight and in my bosom she is still cherished
as the faithful but deluded perhaps fatally deluded victim of
baseness and cruelty

                                                       again farewell

this letter had evidently been written after my alarm in the avenue by
the wretched writers sudden disappearance his narrative was detached
from it and bore several dates as will appear may heaven in its mercy
lend a portion of its neverfailing compassion to those to whom the
miserable harriet now consigns it may they pause from time to time and
contemplate the noble ruin thus exhibited to their view for
maclairns justice will acknowledge it to be such and he will applaud
the woman who although shrinking from the consciousness of guilt
dares to avow her veneration and love for virtue she must indeed be
sunk who could erase from her memory a man like charles duncan and
maclairn will understand and fret that the heart would be unworthy of
his which should not have room for suffering and oppressed innocence
and a memory faithful in its tribute of sorrow and sympathy gratitude
and admiration for a man who not only loved her but also her fame
better than himself yes he will acknowledge that his harriet even in
these tears which she gives to suffering and departed worthbut let me
hasten to the conclusion of a task which duty prescribes before my
sinking spirits faint




                               chap iv


                     charles duncans narrative

                                                               london

i will be calm is it fit for a wretch like me to flinch at the sight
of inanimate objects to tremble and faint in a street because once
trodden by my feet when youth and health glowed in my cheek and hope
in my bosom is it for me familiar with misery to droop at the view
of that abode in which i once for a moment grasped the fleeting form of
happiness gazed on her image and fixed her lineaments on my heart and
then i saw her vanish no duncan ought to have a soul braced an arm
nerved for the work before him his maker has not forgotten the work of
his hand he will triumph even in this world oh memory unfold thy
tablets show to my injured wife the man she loved the man she has wept
as worthlessand then

is it needful for me to recall to my harriets recollection our mutual
doubts of flamalls honour and principles as these appeared in his
conduct to me they were grounded on his evading every enquiry i made
relative to the deceased mrs duncans effects and papers but i had
still more convincing proofs of his real character than i discovered to
his sister i saw that in his professional line he had few clients of
respectability and that he was a rascal determined on my conduct as
soon as i could legally call on him to account for his i simply
declared to you my purpose of quitting his house the day i should come
of age and you concurred in this plan is it necessary to remind you of
those tender fears and apprehensions which resulted from our union oh
no you cannot have forgotten them nor my arguments for your
immediately leaving a house in which you were subjected to perpetual
alarms you will also recollect that we both believed our liberality to
the keiths had bound them to our interest particularly mrs keith who
had gratefully acknowledged my gift of mrs duncans apparel and the
little advantages which her slender purse derived from her being my
laundress

passing near her house one morning just before you left london with
your friends the hatchways a drayman so completely bespattered me
that in order to shun the laughter of the diverted witnesses of this
mischance i took refuge at mrs keiths knowing that i could there
change my linen c during her kind offices about me i observed that
she had been weeping and whilst waiting for my coat to dry her
dejection led me to ask her what had disturbed her only the old
story answered she weeping anew i am weary of my life my husband
was never good but of late he is a brute and beats me because i
cannot go to market without money god help me i am too honest for
patrick he ought to husband his money better replied i he is in
constant employment with mr flamall i find and he is a good copier
he will never find that any thing he gains from that quarter will
thrive answered she colouring with resentment the good old proverb
is against him what is got by the devils means will go as it came
you ought not to blame mr flamall observed i prolonging my toilet
that he cannot teach your husband to take care of the money he earns
flamall is not a spendthrift he is too cunning for you to
understand replied she nodding her head significantly but he will
soon show the cloven foot what is to become of you when your wife
wants a cradle for her poor babe patrick swears that i shall not take
her in the lord help you both there will be such doings and no mrs
duncan to stand by you with her purse i defy mr flamall answered
i and will soon let him know that i can protect my wife in less than
four months i shall be master of my dear mothers little provision and
with that and industry my harriet shall have a cradle for our infant
she shook her head despondingly poor soul said she it is perhaps
happy for her that she is removed she loved you better than many real
mothers do their children it would have grieved her to see you set fast
so young how came you to know this secret asked i without
betraying my emotions because i heard mrs duncan say that she was
not your mother answered she when she gave her dying instructions to
your honest guardian with the pocket book for you in case you
outlived her besides this i could say more if i pleased but i do not
wish to bring patrick to the gallows he will find the road without my
help see his tender marks added she weeping and uncovering her
bosom it was bruised my compassion soothed her but she became more
guarded and only confessed that i had not been well used adding i
have said enough to you and should my husband know it he would murder
me but the time may come when you will be able to take care of me i
have not forgotten the black pocket book nor the letters on it studded
with silver nor what is more the bank notes it contained i know that
ten hundred make a thousand as well as the lawyer betty keith is
neither deaf nor blind in vain did i urge her to be more explicit so
i will when i am upon oath answered she but you can do nothing at
present and you must be gone my husband may return and he will
suspect i have been prating as he calls it when i do but turn the
tongue in my head i took the hint and giving her a guinea left the
room you were on the eve of your little voyage ill and dejected and i
forbore to add to your inquietude your departure followed and duncans
fate advanced to the crisis which terminated his hopes and prospects in
this world a few days passed my bosom was relieved of its fears for
your safety you wrote in spirits and you concurred in your second
letter in my plan of removing you from yth to the north and from
thence declaring your marriage to your brother at this juncture i
received an anonymous letter it was dated from helvoetsluys the
language english with foreign idioms the writer signified that he was
deputed by my parents to inform me that the mystery in which my birth
had been involved was removed but for many cogent reasons which should
be explained he was commissioned to meet me at harwich that he should
perhaps be there as soon as his letter but at all hazards in a few
days and should wait my arrival at the ship inn be only anxious
added he to be punctual to this rendezvous measures for your future
destination in the world will result from this interview be on the
reserve with those about you and above all trust not the man who calls
himself your guardian he has an eye over him which he little suspects
and he will have an account to settle not with the obscure and
friendless charles duncan but with an arm of power which shall crush
him as the spoiler of the widow and the orphan

you will imagine that my whole soul was fixed on accomplishing the
journey to harwich it so entirely engaged my thoughts that i spoke of
my intention to simons saying i should ask mr flamall for a week or
ten days holiday in order to meet a friend at harwich he will refuse
you replied he for he wants you in the office to supply his own
absence he can find leisure for his own jaunts but he thinks not of
us i will not be refused replied i eagerly then do as i do in
such cases said he send your trunk off before you and take a french
leave when you can in order to bring home your portmanteau there will
be no end of his objections

i availed myself of simonss counsel and sent a small portmanteau to
the harwich coach that evening on the following morning i civilly
requested your brother to spare me ten days or a fortnight explaining
to him my wishes in part by saying that i expected to meet a friend at
harwich and we should probably make a little excursion together good
god how delightful were my prospects for these were bounded by seeing
you and announcing my parents to you some questions for which i was
prepared followed reluctance gradually yielded he thought it but an
idle expence but i had been frugal and therefore he should not refuse
me and opening his desk he paid me my quarterly stipend of twenty
guineas which had been due nearly a month he soon after told simons
that he was going with a party of friends to windsor and should not
return for a day or two then carelessly asking me when and how i
intended to journey he left us shaking me by the hand and with a
judass smile he bade me remember that my purse had not the virtue of
fortunatuss simons boasted much of a horse which a friend of his let
out and so strongly pointed out to me the advantages of travelling in
this mode that i went with him to the livery stable in order to see
the animal thus recommended it had been a fine one but had been ridden
down and i should have given up my project of riding on horseback but
for his persuasions he was certain the beast would travel well with me
and return better than when he set out the terms were easy and to
please simons i consented to please his friend the proprietor of the
horse amongst the various arguments he used was one which had probably
turned the scale i could run down to rumford that night the horse had
been at the manger the whole day and the remainder of the road to
harwich was light work this project was adopted but a heavy rain
stopped me for some hours and it was nine oclock in the evening when i
mounted and parted with my officious friend at the livery stable the
clouds were dispersed and the moon though not in her zenith favouring
me i proceeded on gently the horse was stiff with fatigue and i found
that simons had taken me in to use his own quaint language i was
within half a mile of woodford a village on the epping road when i was
accosted by name by a man whom i recollected having seen once or twice
in your brothers office he checked the bridle and civility obliged me
to stop enquiries after mr flamalls health were followed by
wondering to meet me so late on such a road i may wonder in my turn
answered i for you have more to apprehend from this damp evening than
i have but you will excuse me i am hastening to stretham still some
miles from hence i spurred my horse and bowing wished him a good
night he shouting after me look to your pistols young man i had
pistols with me but i needed them not i proceeded unmolested in my
journey till within a mile of rumford when the miserable beast i rode
making a trip fell and i received a contusion on my knee that for a
time prevented my rising and totally disabled me from mounting again
with much difficulty i reached an inn at rumford leading the horse and
in my wish to find shelter i became indifferent to accommodations i
took the first house that was open and found with civility a bed to
which i instantly repaired the next morning i found the injury i had
received too serious to allow me to prosecute my journey without
hazard on simonss vaunted horse i therefore sent the beast home with
a note to simons mentioning my accident and the necessity i was under
of pursuing my journey in a post chaise as it was absolutely my purpose
to be at harwich on the saturday my hostess had in the mean time
with much humanity applied her infallible nostrum to my knee and on my
quitting her the following day she generously insisted on my taking
some of the ointment with me assuring me that by being repeated it
would relieve not only the tumour but the pain in this point she was
however mistaken and on reaching the appointed inn at harwich i could
not stand on my legs the waiter who assisted me into the house asked
me whether my name was duncan and being answered in the affirmative
he proceeded to tell me that a person had called twice within the
hour to enquire for me not doubting but this was my incognito friend
and that he would return to the house i ordered him to be conducted to
me and dismissed the man for some coffee during this interval of
suspense and curiosity my knee solicited my attention it was extremely
painful and i had recourse to my rumford landladys specific for a
bruise whilst employed in applying most assuredly what most assuredly
augmented the evil the door of the apartment was suddenly opened and
to my inconceivable surprise simons hastily entered you are come at
last said he with an oath i have been on the rack these two hours
and i for near four and twenty replied i interrupting him and
directing his attention to my employment but what brings you hither
he grasped my hand with eagerness and in a low voice told me that he
came to save my life i laughed i believe for he swore most horridly
and concluded by saying that he had not time to see me play the fool
the person added he commissioned by your father to meet you here
is no stranger to me let it suffice i am in his secret he is it may
be at this instant dying at helvoetsluys of a fever and i am ordered
to conduct you there to him all is prepared and you must go this
instant on board the packet there is not a moment to lose i
hesitated for i thought of my harriet but he urged me with a vehemence
that confounded my deliberations and concluded by saying that my
honour and even my life depended on my following him with his help
and a porters i was conveyed to the waterside and there found the
boat in which we reached the packet then getting under sail i threw
myself on the bed reserved for me subdued by the pain in my knee and
soon after was seized with the sea sickness i saw no more of my
companion that night and learned that fearing to share in the common
malady he preferred being on deck it was with difficulty that i
supported myself to the public house at the sluys but overcome as i
was with pain i failed not to remark that simons spoke the dutch
language fluently it is well i can answered he roughly to my
observation for your friend is not here we must proceed to rotterdam
and you must bear up as well as you can the passageboat is an easy
conveyance for you this boat was shared by others as well as ourselves
and with an irritation of mind as great as my bodily sufferings we
proceeded to rotterdam and on reaching the hotel i fainted on
recovering my senses which had been suspended for some time i saw a
well dressed man engaged in giving me succour and i concluded that this
was the person i was to meet on asking simons whether he was the dying
man i had been led to expect he answered that he was a surgeon and
that my knee required some better remedy than i had applied i submitted
to his orders and was carried to bed at length simons was at leisure
to satisfy my curiosity he began the subject himself by observing with
some illhumour that it was unluckyi omit the epithets my harriet
with which he interlarded even his expressions of kindness that what
with the indisposition of my friend and my accident which he found
from the surgeon would unavoidably detain me some days in my bed he
should be forced to prolong his stay i have written to amsterdam
continued he where i find the sick man was advised to remain
tomorrow or the next day we shall have letters need i say in what
manner this interval was filled up by me i wrote you a circumstantial
account of these various events and the fond wish of making my harriet
easy under a separation so unexpected imparted to my bosom a portion of
those hopes which were necessary for her support as well as mine this
letter i intrusted to the surgeons care not chusing to employ simons
i made him comprehend that it was of importance to me and with a
goodnatured smile he satisfied me that he would faithfully discharge
his trust it was under cover to mrs keith too fatally certain is it
that you never saw this letter in the mean time my soul was on the
rack from having no intelligence of you again and again i wrote to
mrs keith and to you i had no letters and i began to suspect the
surgeon had given simons my letters instead of putting them into the
postoffice in the mean time his attention to my accommodations and
health had nothing in them to surprise me for he constantly talked of
his being commissioned by the gentleman at amsterdam to be careful of
his precious charge and sometimes he translated passages from his
letters expressive of the importance of my person and his anxiety in
not being in a state to attend me himself i was now on crutches and
free from pain and i was told that it was proper for me to proceed to
amsterdam i decidedly refused saying that i was determined to return
to england and he might inform his correspondent of my resolution it
being indispensibly necessary for my peace to have news from thence i
will furnish you with a newspaper said he gravely that will i
trust make you change your mind but it may not be amiss to prepare you
for news that will surprise you more than you are aware he began his
narrative of the highway robbery charged on me and finished by placing
before me the article in the days paper which with a detail of the
particulars included a description of my person situation and even
the initials of my name and of the master with whom i served as clerk
you will judge my harriet of the effect which this intelligence
produced i solemnly swore that no power on earth should prevent my
immediately appearing and confronting the base and false accuser you
know best replied simons the proofs with which you can invalidate
this mans positive oath but i would advise you rather to secure such
a condition of fortune as will of itself with nine hundred and
ninetynine out of a thousand prove that you are slandered in a
word continued he with a serious air i have had my instructions
from those who will take care of your honour better than you are able
to do yourself your parents are rich and powerful and trust me more
than one will be called to a strict account for their conduct in
regard to you i was still resolved on my measures for my wifes
deplorable condition solely engaged me it is well sir observed he
with a tone of authority i shall proceed without you and even if it
be necessary to cadiz and inform your noble parents that you preferred
a gibbet to them but you are a simpleton duncan added he with
more kindness i know your motive for this headstrong folly will your
appearance and the charge which will be brought against you lessen the
distress of the girl you love i started i know more than you think
of that business also continued he and i advise you to write to her
and instantly make your way to your parents you will then be able to
offer her the protection she needs i burst into tears and reproached
him with having stopped my letters he vehemently denied the charge
adding that he pitied miss flamall and was better pleased to serve
her than to injure her

unable to extract more from a man who hourly assumed with me more of
respect as well as of authority i yielded to his control i was
still lame and helpless and except the diminished sum with which your
brother had furnished me i had no resources for my premeditated plan
simons soothed me by conducting me to the postoffice where i
deposited a letter for you and his orders taken to forward all letters
to our address at cadiz to a house of business sufficiently ostensible
to gain him attention with the people at the office we prepared
immediately for our departure for amsterdam when he entered the
apartment with an opened letter in his hand i thought how it would
be said he your cursed accident and the delay it has occasioned
will oblige me to go the whole voyage with you your fathers agent is
too ill for the voyage he has sent me bills of exchange he displayed
the notes and urged me to lose no time he is i find in the country
and dangerously ill however i am embarked and will not desert you at
amsterdam i was again surprised this proteus spoke the spanish tongue
well and in his conversation with the captain of a spanish ship bound
for cadiz i perceived that he assumed the gravity and stateliness of a
spanish grandee on the mans leaving us after having settled the terms
for our accommodation i mentioned my surprise on finding him so
qualified for a traveller i lived on the continent some time in my
young days answered he i was private secretary to an ambassador who
in his lack of brains forgot to pay me for the five years use he made
of mine he taught me a lesson however which i wanted continued he
with a malicious grin namely to live by my own wit and to regard
every man either as a fool or a knave it required very little
judgment my dear harriet to determine the class to which simons
belonged yet in spite of his habitual vulgarity and coarse language i
hourly perceived that he had moved in a different sphere and could at
his pleasure assume the gentleman he spoke of me as a spaniard by
birth and by the respect he showed me taught those about me to
consider me as of importance performing the part of my governor and
making no secret of my having been a stranger to my rank parents and
country from nearly the hour i was born these hints were needless to
stimulate a curiosity constantly on the fullest stretch to my questions
i received only one answer i am bound to secresy and it is for my
interest to be faithful have patience time will discover all to you
thus goaded on and convinced of my inability of securing him in my
interest having exhausted my own little stock of money and depending
in a strange country upon simons for pecuniary assistance i left
amsterdam without having received letters from you and in the anguish
of my soul i sought relief from the hope of meeting with protection and
being placed in a situation to succour you for i made no doubt of your
brothers interference with your wishes to write to me our navigation
was for a time pleasant the gentle breezes which filled our sails soon
exempted me from sea sickness rest restored my knee and my hours were
beguiled by my assiduously studying the spanish language for which
simons having proposed it for my amusement i had purchased a few
needful books

at this period however one incidental cause of sorrow was added to my
oppressive burden two or three days after your departure from town i
had began to bathe trusting to its relieving me from a portion at
least of that languor which i experienced and cautiously guarded in
all that related to my harriet had taken your picture from my bosom
and placed it in my portfolio with your letters which i carefully kept
locked in a large trunk with articles that were not of every days use
i had seen on reaching helvoetsluys that this trunk made the greatest
part of our baggage and on noticing it to simons he replied that he
expected my thanks for his zeal in my service in bringing it as he
supposed it was kept as lumber in my room and that i should have no
objection to a change of linen to this necessity i had been hitherto a
stranger and the trunk remained corded till i was settled in my cabin
on board the spanish ship the treasure it contained was too precious to
be forgotten i searched for it in vain neither your letters nor your
portrait were to be found i did not conceal my suspicions nor my
distress from simons who as usual with the most horrid imprecations
affirmed that he had not opened the trunk nor had any other motive in
removing it but that of contributing to my comforts and amusement
knowing that i had some books in it to contest with simons was a vain
attempt i was silenced and bore this trial to use my masters words
like a whining puppy yet in spite of himself i perceived that he had
an interest in preserving my health and tranquillity and that he never
ceased to recommend to me patience hinting continually that i should
soon be in a condition to take ample vengeance on those who had injured
me and to protect you who had been so unjustly dealt with these
conversations with his avowed good will for you and pity for me had
their effect

we were within thirty or forty leagues of our post when we were boarded
by a large wellarmed algerine corsair and taken without resistance
for such was the inferiority of our force that it was not possible for
us to escape surprised and confounded by an event for which i was
altogether unprepared my compassion was notwithstanding exerted in
comforting my terrified companion i strove to encourage him by the same
hopes which had calmed my own spirits and with confidence i assured
him that as subjects of great britain we should be enlarged at algiers
and that we had only to apply to the british consul resident there in
order to be protected in this expectation we were cruelly disappointed
by the measures which the pirate pursued who from motives we could not
fathom after having treated me with extraordinary lenity and simons
without rigour landed us with great circumspection during the night at
some distance from the harbour and to our amazement and consternation
we were with our chests placed in a covered vehicle not unlike a
waggon and without loss of time conducted up the country we were
manacled and vigilantly concealed from every eye by those who were
charged with us who still maintained their claims to our gratitude by
offering us no violence or harshness i had not been much surprised at
seeing simons relapsing into the pusillanimity he had betrayed in the
first moments of our capture but i was astonished to find that with
his grief for himself and the most bitter execrations on his folly he
bemoaned my hard fate in terms which i little expected from him take
courage said i willing to relieve his sorrow you have nothing to
reproach yourself with in this misfortune and i am sorry that your
good intentions and zeal for my service have led you into this
difficulty but we may yet find the means of applying to the consul or
purchasing our freedom do not despair i must replied he with a
look of horror i have been a dd rascal and your destruction my
poor boy if you were to forgive me god never will and this is only
the beginning of my punishment he wept in agonies and i was alarmed
i can neither be useful to you nor yet forgive you observed i
desisting from my ineffectual attempts to soothe his agitations till
i am more in your confidence tell me what have you done to injure me
and trust to my principles which command me to forgive an offending
brother by gd exclaimed he this is too much i cannot bear it
villain as i am but you shall know all and you shall see that at least
i never intended to harm you though it is but too true that my business
in your concerns was to serve myself

                charles duncans narrative continued

i will not my dear harriet attempt to give you in the language of a
reprobate the confession of one let it suffice that i faithfully
communicate to you the information which he in the course of our three
days journey poured into my appalled ear and when his recital is
cleared from his oaths it will be as follows you may date your ruin
said he from the hour you were at grantham in your way to london with
mrs duncan your supposed mother i started let me at once tell
you observed he that i know more of your history than you do
yourself therefore do not interrupt me you met there a very handsome
courteous lady who took the coach with you from thence she called
herself mrs peachley she is flamalls wife and sister to keith you
know her kindness in recommending your mother to keiths lodgings your
indisposition on the journey was declared the following day you could
not rise and mrs duncan with much alarm recommended you to mrs
keiths care and lamented the necessity which forced her from your bed
side for an hour or two having an appointment which could not be
delayed at her return she found you much worse and a physician was
summoned for several days and nights this good mother of yours never
left you you were every hour nearer the grave and overcome by her
fatigue and terror she got the start of you for she was dead and
buried before your eight and twenty days fever had fairly left you
during this time when you were for the greater part more fit for
bedlam or for your coffin mrs duncan was kindly visited by mrs
peachley who having called to see her relations discovered that she
had found a prey worth pursuing and finding that her brother had
inmates not likely to cavil at the price of his lodgings she redoubled
her attentions by several times calling on mrs duncan to enquire
after you and as she said to see that the keiths were assiduous in
their attendance your poor mother who knew not a being in london but
the person she had met the day of her arrival and who was out of town
mentioned with extreme distress that in an hour of such difficulty
she had the additional misfortune of finding that her only friend had
left london and was gone abroad this confidence became more enlarged
in proportion as your danger was more imminent she incessantly lamented
the absence of this mr joseph jago and in her illness she consulted
mrs peachley on the means she should take to secure to you the little
property which her death would give you in case you survived her mr
flamalls good offices were employed and she made her will which was
witnessed by her two doctors you were left to mr flamalls care and
your money into the bargain until such time as his trust should be set
aside by your natural guardians who lived abroad or until you were of
age in case these relations did not appear hitherto all went well but
keiths wife either from hatred of her sister or the spirit of
contradiction common to her thought it a good opportunity of acting
like an honest woman she was careful of you during your delirium and
also attentive to your poor mother your generosity when you left her
house for mr flamalls confirmed her good dispositions towards you i
had not been without my suspicions that the cautions which kept me in
the back ground all this time were not used without solid reasons
flamall however in the executive trust which had thus devolved on
him brought home with him on the night of the funeral some papers
which belonged to the deceased mrs duncan in order for their better
security as he said and he then mentioned you and your condition
adding that he did not think you could survive your mother and that he
had no clue to any of your connexions he spoke of your little property
in the funds and the suspicion he entertained that mrs duncan was not
your real mother why do you not examine her letters asked i i
have answered he but they are written in spanish and i do not wish
to have this young mans story published unnecessarily if he live he
may be able to give an account of himself and if he die they must be
translated i am able to do that replied i and it may be prudent
to know the ground you tread flamall understood the tone with which
this observation was made and he gave me three or four letters from a
pocket book which he said the defunct had in her trunk and which
constituted all the papers that could lead to an explanation of a
secret which she had too long deferred to communicate i shall only
notice to you continued simons those passages which struck me the
most two or three of the letters contained little more than most tender
expressions of maternal affection and the most pathetic description of
the writers hopes and fears as these related to you one of a later
date informed mrs duncan that jachimo de castros had been summoned by
the duke to  his agency being more important there than in england
that his services were supplied by the orders he had left with a tried
friend joseph jago a merchant in the minories to whom she was to
apply in every exigency and who would forward her letters another of
a later and recent date was still more important but it was like the
oracles of old to me joy dictated the broken sentences much was said
of a picture which heaven in its mercy had placed in mrs duncans
hands joseph jago would supply her with a thousand pounds her
henrico was to be cautiously introduced to a knowledge of a mother
whose miseries were forgotten in the hopes of clasping her son her
long lost blessing to her bosom spare no expence for the masters he
may yet need adds the writer it must be yet some months before all
is ready for his appearance here when with an exultation the thoughts
of which transports me to extasy his mother will be proclaimed
innocent and he my margaret his fathers heir no signature was
added to these letters but it was now my turn to be cautious i gave
mr flamall not the most exact translation of their contents and he
observed that they would do you more harm than good for it was clear
you were a bastard and had lost your best friend who had happily left
you enough for bread assisted by your industry i was soon the friend
of keith from him i only got hints that quickened my curiosity his
wife was more pliant she informed me that mrs duncan had written a
long letter to joseph jago four days before she died and had in her
hearing desired that mr flamall should send it to his house her
husband was entrusted with it and the gentleman was told that his
partner had received it and had promised to forward it without delay
now added she i know this was a lie for it was in mr flamalls
pocket at the time and this is nothing to what i could say if i chose
i was as yet continued simons only on the threshold and i
forbore to press my questions flamall was close and yet i found he
was in cash keith had also money and it was my business to diminish
his stock this was soon effected and one night he said that he had
been a cursed fool for he might have made a man of himself had he
insisted on his due i urged him however by reminding him that he
ought to have known flamall and the jade his sister yes replied he
but they are always too cunning for me though i know what was in the
pocket case and so does my wife one of ten only of the notes came
to my share for all my trouble i could not get more from him but i
knew then my next step was to the minories your mothers joseph jago
was a rich jew merchant and i found his house without difficulty i was
received into an office of business where several clerks were at the
desk and one who appeared to take the lead civilly asked me my
business my enquiries led to his answers mr jagos absence was
undetermined but any letters or commissions i might have would be
punctually sent him to cadiz with his own letters could i be
favoured with his address certainly but he had reason to believe his
friend was then at madrid however any letters directed for him to the
house of jachimo de castros would reach him he courteously desired one
of the young men to write the address and presenting it to me i
withdrew

so far all went well for my purpose and i was doing you no mischief
but i will at once tell you that i had motives for my conduct in which
you had not the least concern flamall had not only kept this whole
transaction from me but had refused to assist me in a difficulty of my
own and it behoved me to have him in my power had he known your
chances in life he would not have sworn to be your ruin when he
discovered that you made love to his sister nor would he have effected
it but for his wife your marriage was no secret to them and i saw
there was a plot brewing to ruin your poor wife as well as yourself
for that she devil hated her because she was virtuous i was
consulted by flamall on this occasion whose rage was checked by my
arguments let it be noted by you here also that he saw as well as i
that you were not a fool nor would be his tool at this juncture i
was one day with him in his office when casually opening a drawer in
his private desk for a mislaid paper i saw a morocco picture case
appear i took my time and on examining it found it not only the
representation of the most beautiful woman i ever beheld but also
enriched with costly diamonds i was at no loss from what quarter it
came nor who had a right to it my plan was now completed for i had
the means in my hands of saving my own head from the pillory at least
and by serving you should gain friends who would better recompense my
services than flamall had done it is dd hard when rogues are not
honest to one another added he for they have no one in that case on
whom to depend but let that pass you had swallowed the bait i had sent
you the anonymous letter answered and you requested permission to go
to harwich all that followed you know but it is for me to inform you
that the honourable gentleman who saluted you on the road to rumford
was mr peachley the uncle of mr flamalls wife who was at that time
in his house which you passed and moreover i was in this secret and
what is more received my fee in gold little did they suspect that
villain as i was i could not nor would not have been in this infernal
business had i not been certain of saving you as well as myself but
you were no sooner departed and the coast clear than i took the
picture and disposing of the frame for our joint convenience i secured
the angel face which i will now give you

you may judge my harriet of the sensations which assailed me when he
produced from its concealment this evidence of my birth and
irreparable ruin it was indeed the countenance of an angel which met my
eyes she was in a spanish habit the painting exquisitely finished and
enamelled my expressions of grief and despair touched simons i am
cursed said he grasping my hand you recant you cannot forgive me
but believe me or not i wished to serve you i was fully convinced
that i should succeed in tracing these men whom i have mentioned and
by this means your father and mother they are noble and rich the
picture frame was finished by a ducal coronet it grieved me to break
it but it was unavoidable i could have proved your identity and given
such evidences of mrs duncans death and the circumstances which had
thrown you into the hands of villains as would have been unanswerable
but i am taken in my own toils added he with vehement and dreadful
imprecations and not allowed to be honest when i wished to be so i
again soothed him and by dwelling on my hopes of procuring my liberty
i solemnly engaged to take care of him to the utmost of my power i
believe you on your word replied he with more composure you have
convinced me that virtue is not a convention of interest nor religion a
lie there was a time when my conduct disgraced neither but i was
young and had passions to gratify which your creed did not suit i was
gulled by a hypocrite robbed by rascals and defrauded of six or eight
years labour by the neglect and ingratitude of the man whom i served by
my talents as much as by my hand your compassion may save me from
worse bonds than even these added he wringing my hand i am old but
i have yet a heart and humanity may make me faithful

misery my harriet does not harden the heart it produced in mine an
interest for this unhappy creatures recovery and comfort and
insensibly he became my consolation for with a fertility of invention
he suggested so many ways of reaching gibraltar and from thence the
object of my wishes that hope was renewed his communications from time
to time gratified my curiosity although the subject of it was diverted
to a less interesting concern than you my beloved wife simons spoke of
you in terms of kindness and pity then again said he i was a
rascal for i knew that her worthy father died in good circumstances
though without having secured to her a provision yet i held my tongue
and was continued in my office with an advanced stipend flamall was
certain as he told me that her beauty would be her fortune and his
advantage and with this scheme in his head she was treated with
kindness under his roof to the great disappointment of his wife who
had hoped to see herself acknowledged as mrs flamall and wherefore
does he keep his marriage a secret even from his sister asked i he
has solid reasons replied he for keeping the lady in the back
ground her alliance is not the most honourable some business in which
she and her uncle were useful to mr flamall obliged him to purchase
her uncles evidence and to silence hers as being his wife but in
return flamall can any day he pleases hang old peachley i was now my
harriet circumstantially informed of a transaction which i shall spare
my pen the task of going over with you but it opened such a scene of
wickedness as to leave no doubts on my mind that your brother was fully
qualified to impose upon your innocence and my soul sickened in
reflecting that you were in the power of a man who to use simonss
words wrote more hands than any man in the profession and with an
exactness so unrivalled that he could impose on the devil himself

on the evening of our fourth days tedious journey we reached the abode
of our new master he was a man of about forty could speak a few words
of english and as many of spanish he examined me with attention my
youth and appearance pleased him but unfortunately the people who had
conducted us from the ship had received an impression which they gave
to him and poor simons was judged to be my domestic you know that his
person is not conciliating and it was in vain that i discovered the
interest i took in his fate we were separated my master taking me with
him the next morning to a house and garden several leagues from the
town in which he was ruler here my philosophy was checked i was
seized by an ardent fever and for many days they thought me dying
nature resisted the attack i was treated humanely and till i had
strength to crawl into the garden and to seek the shade they
assiduously carried me to the fountain which they perceived i liked
but my grief was beyond their kind offices i had lost my mothers
picture and i understood that my patron had it he at length
condescended to visit me for i believe he thought me a man above the
common sort my tears and intreaties produced nothing he replied that
the lady pleased him it was pretty and by mohammed he would keep the
painting to soften this obduracy he sent me my books and linen and i
was given to understand that i was to teach him english when i was well

i next implored him to send my friend to me he evaded my request and i
conceived from the signs made me that he was removed too far from me to
render it easy to accomplish the gentleness of my bondage in the mean
time kept hope alive for although i had the habit and the badge of
slavery i had no cause for complaint as my strength recruited i was
employed in light labour in the garden and my mind was engaged by
assiduously learning the moorish language again and again i pleaded
for the society of my friend but in vain at length i was told that he
was dead and the first use i made of my more familiar knowledge of the
language gave me the detailed circumstances of his miserable end his
grief and impatience on being separated from me was shown in a manner
which the people about him neither understood nor pitied he refused
food and they chastised his obstinacy he became more determined and
he was left to himself and time for the remedy nature at length
conquered he asked for food by signs expressive of his wants and
submission and they incautiously placed before him some boiled rice and
water of which he ate and drank so voraciously that he died in great
agonies a few hours after

i found in this relation my harriet my last human tie dissolved and i
deplored the loss of a man whom in happier circumstances of fortune i
should it is probable have scorned for his vices and condemned as a
being lost to every virtuous feeling but isolated as i stood simons
was a prop and i could not think of him as a man who had outlived
humanity but to return to my more immediate purpose my patron pleased
with my rapid progress in his language now became a pupil for mine and
with much curiosity he would listen to my reading and imperfect
translations of the english authors but he soon relaxed from his
ardour the labour discouraged him and he contented himself with
occasionally conversing with me in his native tongue my story produced
no compassion he had long desired to have an englishman in his house
and as such i should by any application at algiers have brought him into
trouble with the dey he therefore chose to believe that i was of
spanish origin my mothers picture was an evidence of this for he had
seen spanish ladies although none so beautiful judge of the torments i
endured when in saying this he would produce the picture and comment
on its superlative beauties thus passed the first three years of my
captivity and my incessant and defeated projects of escaping to
algiers at this period my patron removed to a more distant province
and i was further removed from every hope two years more were passed in
that languor of mind which the annihilation of hope occasioned my
master discovered that he had gained no advantage from having an
english slave i was too feeble for labour and too pensive for his
amusement and without a scruple of conscience or a mark of regret he
exchanged me for a fine arabian horse which pleased him and with the
most unpitying indifference refused to restore to me my mothers
picture saying that i had been a costly bargain

with my new master my toils were incessant but to what purpose should
i detail these years of misery to my harriet wherefore should i attempt
to delineate chaos in which nothing of my former train of thought
appeared but the remembrance of the wife whom i had left in the power
of a demon it would be a fruitless attempt to give language to
feelings which at times overpowered my reason but man my harriet is
no less incomprehensible than the power which has endued him with the
force to resist suffering in the days of ease and enjoyment the
principles of his soul lie dormant he shrinks from the slightest blast
which annoys his enervated body and mind given up to adversity to
hardship and labour all his powers exert their energy to preserve an
existence of which he is weary like the animals it was my office to
watch and serve i slept after my allotted toil and in the morning
awoke to the privileges of the man and the prospects of the
christian how often did i bless my maker for the hopes of the gospel
how often recall to my mind the lessons of my tender and pious mrs
duncan my mind was soothed by the hope that you were dead my
harriet and i exulted in the thought of meeting with you in a world of
bliss my master at this period sold me to another he was on the eve
of a long and fatiguing journey and he had the wisdom to perceive that
my strength was unequal to the duties it would unavoidably impose i
was in consequence sold to another arabian merchant but one much more
wealthy than the master i had so laboriously served during his
wandering desultory journeys in his traffic of buying female slaves to
my unspeakable relief i found that i was with others in my masters
suite furnished with a horse for our journey of which each rider had
the care and my good fortune for once appeared one of the most
valuable of these beautiful animals was suddenly seized with an
indisposition which must in a few hours have proved fatal from the
means used to preserve his life my master despaired of his recovery
and i ventured to propose copious bleeding my advice was taken and i
was the operator the horse recovered and my favour was established
our journey terminated at my masters home and we became stationary
his only son a youth of about sixteen became attached to me and for
a time i entertained the romantic hope of cultivating a mind not
deficient in natural endowments but the moment my pupil found that
amusement led to application he lost his relish for ibrahims
instructions his father a quiet indolent man had in the first
instance of the sons preference of me formally given me to him not
displeased by the modes of instruction i had adopted nor was he without
hope that my example and precepts might restrain the impetuosity of his
sons temper i still hope that i contributed to the amelioration of
the soil though i was unable to sow the seed i wished to see spring up
he exchanged me with perfect indifference for a young female slave but
with generosity he recommended me to my new patron as something more
than a common man adding that i knew all things whether this
character or my reserved although resigned behaviour produced the
effect is not a question of any importance here but it is certain
that he treated me with kindness and conceived that i should repay him
by the price he had affixed to my talents he was by birth an american
his traffic had conducted him into many remote regions and i found in
his conversation both improvement and amazement time had blunted the
keen anguish of my wounded bosom bondage was familiar to my dejected
spirits i was a nonentity to all but my maker and in contemplating
his arms of mercy i could smile at my chains in the course of two
years i had with my patron journied by sea and land until we at
length reached grand cairo where induced by the profit accruing from
my sale he parted with me to a turk of some estimation in the eyes of
his countrymen for he was opulent and well protected he was advanced
in years had a noble countenance and spoke to me with a dignified and
placid courteousness bidding me look upon him with confidence i
obeyed and our eyes met good god when i perceived the tremulous signs
of humanity the sympathetic greeting of his still expressive
lineaments my soul melted within me i was unable to resist the sweet
invitation of pity and i burst into tears instead of paying him the
exacted homage of a slave to his master he turned aside and i saw
yes my harriet i saw the tear roll down his venerable face here for
a time was my harbour of repose my benefactor and my friend listened
to my tale of woe and whether it arose from the suggestion of an
enlightened reason or from the benevolence of his heart he neither
blamed me for adhering to my religion nor recommended to me his own
once and once only he said with a smile be discreet ibrahim and be
true to allah in thy services and whether thou art a follower of jesus
or of mohammed he will acknowledge thee i bowed in silence and i
gave no offence by being steadfast in my faith in the gospel




                               chap vi


                charles duncans narrative concluded

i again return to my story the recital of my life produced an effect
which the good abdallah had not foreseen he frequently indulged me in
the recapitulation of those circumstances of my disastrous fortune
which no interval of time had been able to erase from my mind he
permitted me my harriet to speak of my wife of my hopes as a parent
and my wounds bled afresh to pity and soothings he added more solid
proofs of his regard i am old observed he and cannot live long
you are a comfort to me and the fate of those you deplore is probably
long since decided i will give you freedom and the means of returning
to your country on condition you remain here and close my eyes i
with gratitude accepted of those terms and some months before he
died he had in presence of the official magistrate formally
registered my freedom he had moreover the precaution to give me a
purse of gold which he ordered me to secrete saying that his death
might leave me pennyless as he could not trust to the generosity of
those who might succeed him i was faithful to my benefactor and in
heaven we shall again be friends

i met with no impediment after his decease in the steps i took for my
farther enlargement and at length with my little treasure i reached
alexandria where i found a french vessel ready to sail for marseilles
in which i embarked as a passenger my early acquaintance with the
mathematics and my desultory voyages with my patron had rendered me no
inexpert seaman our navigation was tedious and the captain an ignorant
babbler for amusement i had recourse to my activity and in the
exercise on deck i saw that the vessel was badly manuvred and in a
crazy condition keeping us constantly at the pump and under
apprehensions for our safety inured to labour and cheerfully giving my
time to the common relief of all i became a favourite with the sailors
which providentially saved their lives and my own within a few leagues
of our port we met with rough weather and a swelling sea succeeded the
gale which was only formidable to a ship in the condition of ours the
leak gained upon us rapidly and the captain in despair gave orders
for the longboat to be prepared and for each man to think of his
preservation the night was dark and the peril obvious in an attempt
to reach land in the boat my arguments prevailed by incessant toil we
kept the vessel floating till day break when we took to the boat and
saw her sink before we had gone half a furlong we reached however the
port and the shipwrecked duncan once more saw himself poor and
friendless but i was free i looked at my muscular arms and i smiled
for i was independent and quitting my companions who were relieved
from their necessities by the charity they solicited i repaired to a
house in order to replenish my strength with bread of my own my
slender purse sufficed however for my wants i had enough to buy me
the dress of a seaman and fortunately finding an american ship bound
for london i offered myself as a shipwrecked englishman willing to
work my passage home something in my voice and manner betrayed my
feelings when i pronounced the word home the captain had the heart
of a man and i was told to take my birth on board that very
evening and that it should be a warm one for he pitied me during the
voyage my quiet melancholy and some accidental discourses of my
learning to use the worthy captains word so augmented the interest
his benevolence had excited in my behalf that on reaching our port he
asked me what were my intentions respecting my future employment i
replied that my first care would be to seek out a friend who if
found would determine my fate and probably place me beyond the reach
of penury but you may not find him replied he viewing with
attention emotions which i was unable to check let me advise you to
keep where you are till you can do better i like you and will retain
you as ship steward you are a good seaman and an honest capable man
and may be the maker of your own fortune i rejected this offer
saying that i knew not whether my private concerns would permit me to
leave england so soon as he would well replied he i will not press
you into my service but i must pay for what you have done i was on the
lookout for a hand to supply one who had left me when we met you have
more than done that fellows duty and you are justly entitled to your
wages he placed ten guineas in my hand and added that whilst the
ship was at her moorings he thought i might as well make her my head
quarters as she would give me a bed and board until a better hammock
was found and in order to make this offer sit easy on your mind
continued he taking my trembling hand you may keep a clear reckoning
by being useful to me with your pen and your sobriety he instantly
left me and at his return i thanked him and entered on my office of
clerkship

my approach to england had opened those wounds which time and religion
had in part closed but i mean not to place before you the condition of
a mind torn by the anguish of reflecting on you and corroded by the
feelings of resentment and the purposes of vengeance which alternately
governed my soul at the sight of london my spirits forsook me my heart
ceased to beat and i was conveyed to my bed in a state of
insensibility would to god i had found in this respite from misery my
final dismissal from sense and sorrow but returning recollection only
restored me to the contemplation of my wretched state forlorn and
friendless cut off from the sweet ties of affinity blasted in fame
stamped with ignominy and marked for justice deprived of the only
comfort the only hope of my life my wife my harriet who had been
either destroyed in the wreck of my fortune or lived to despise and to
curse me as her undoeroh let me pause

i now wore life away one purpose absorbed my every sense of fatigue
every fear for my safety no traces of the keiths remained untrod these
ended in disappointments another family had established themselves in
the square and even that had changed in many respects its former
aspect for i scarcely saw on the doors a name that i could recall to my
memory yet to this spot was i irresistibly drawn and for hours
together have i paced it one day and towards its close i perceived
that i excited the curiosity of the people who passed me and that one
person in particular was observing me from the window of that abode in
which i had tasted of the cup of bliss in order as it should seem to
know more acutely that of wretchedness i instinctively turned down a
passage leading into ormond street in passing a small shop the window
of which displayed with the food of the poor the humble luxuries of
penny pies and tarts i stopped with others in order to appease the
wrath of the woman whose property had been invaded by a child of about
ten years old whom she had detected in stealing a tart her fury was
subdued by some one who paid for the delinquents trespass and the
collected persons continued their way with the weeping and terrified
girl from the train of thought which this little incident had produced
in my mind i was recalled to the consideration of the harridans face
who wondering probably at mine and my remaining before her door
asked me what i wished for i instantly recognized the girl when in
former times i had daily passed at her station near the passage i was
then in where sitting by a wheelbarrow she sold her similar
commodities and exhibited a face which time could not change for a
claret coloured mark so completely covered one side of it as to form a
half mask and with this defect she was moreover exceedingly deformed
struck by the conviction of her being a person who must have some
knowledge of mr flamalls family i entered the shop and placing
myself on an old chest which half filled it i asked for some cold meat
she applied herself to cutting and weighing it do not spare it said
i throwing down half a crown i am hungry and faint having walked
from wapping and my return thither tonight must be provided for could
you procure me a pint of porter in a moment answered she with
alacrity calling to a boy opposite who as instantly supplied the
demand my questions followed and as the prelude to them i told her i
thought i had seen her many years back when i was often a visitor in a
family who then resided in red lion square but that i fancied they
were removed not seeing the name of flamall in the square very
likely answered she mine is a face not easily forgotten but i thank
god thirtyfive years standing at my barrow have proved it an honest
one and you see me now with a house over my head which will i hope
better shelter me than many in the square have done those who passed me
in all their glory and pride was mr flamall one of those who lived
too fast for his holding the station he was in when i knew him asked
i oh dear no replied she there was no fear of that he knew too
well how to get money to be in danger of being poor he sold his house
when he married his sister to a rich old man and took rooms in
lincolns inn he was too high to be called an attorney and it has been
forsooth counsellor flamall from that time i must find him
observed i for i have some business with him as an attorney a
relation of mine left him to manage her affairs when she died and i
shall expect my little legacy i wish you may find it answered she
but they say he is a sharp one and loves money it was a shame to
marry as he did that beautiful young creature his sister to an old
hunks of seventy but i suppose the young lady was consulted observed
i i suppose so too answered she for god be praised they cannot
in this country force a poor girl to the altar but as i have been
told miss flamall was brokenhearted for the loss of a sweetheart and
for a long time thought to be dying and she did not care what became of
her honour she has been lucky on the whole for the old man soon left
her a widow and she married a very proper looking gentleman and is now
called my lady but it is years since i have seen her and she may or
may not be living for she went into the north with her first husband
and i have never seen her since nor should i have known thus much but
from an acquaintance who lived sometime with her as cook when she kept
her brothers house what was the girls name asked i i remember
one who lived in the family at the time my aunt died when i was
frequently at the house on the business in question mary nutt
replied she without embarrassment but she married and died in
childbed poor soul my enquiries terminated here my agonies were not
to be concealed and hastily rising observing that i should be late i
withdrew the woman loudly calling to me to take my change it was
already dark and the intelligence i had received had harrowed up every
image of despair in my benighted soul shall i retrace the horrors of
that night when wandering from street to street my footsteps conducted
me to the river side i stopped i summed up the blessings i had lost i
became desperate harriet the moment of perdition was suspended by a
watchmans passing me who roughly asked me what i was about i replied
that i wanted a boat you will do well to wait till day break
answered he surveying me with attention come my poor fellow let me
show you a house where you will be safe subdued by the gracious
interposition which had saved me i burst into tears and thanking the
man i said i would walk to my ship naming it and captain nelson you
are a cup too low observed he come i will share a pot with you you
are an honest man by your looks but you must not remain here i
complied and he led the way to a public house which was open i shared
with him the porter he called for and he returned to his duty exacting
from me a promise that i would wait for day light it came harriet
and i determined to live and to take ample vengeance on my destroyers
head the state of my mind was such as to admit of no impediments in my
projects of revenge i informed captain nelson that i was going into the
country in the hope of meeting with a person whom it was necessary for
me to see again he pressed me to continue with him but finding me
determined he contented himself with again supplying my purse with five
guineas and recommending me in the strongest terms to the owner of the
wharf he used and who happened to be present this man engaged to
employ me in case my necessities should oblige me to labour for my
bread and giving me his address he bade me come to him should my
journey not turn out to my expectation i had no chains to impede my
feet but measuring the distance by land and my strength i preferred
working down my passage to newcastle having learned from the porter at
lincolns inn that mr flamall was at his brothers sir murdoch
maclairns seat near durham

aware of the impression which sorrow has given to my toilworn
countenance i have personated here a shipwrecked and sick mariner and
pity gave me shelter here ends my eventful tale and here terminates
the decree of heaven which pronounced that charles duncan should have
no friend no comforter but that being in whose approbation he should
find peace and repose i have seen you i have heard your voice i
listened to your accents of melting tenderness and sympathy when you
talked of your husband he is a man said you of whom it may with
truth be said that he has been steeped in affliction yet my malcolm
like his divine master he bows resigned to his cross he murmurs
notbut in his sufferings teaches us patience and to whom was this
said to your son to maclairns child no frenzy followed this scene of
anguish but tears my harriet which like the dew of heaven on the
parched earth allayed the fever of my disturbed brain and solaced my
burning bosom i forgot myself i saw only in my harriet maclairns
wife and his sons mother dignified and matured by that virtue which
had attracted my adoration

persevere most excellent of thy sex fulfil the duties of thy station
forget that i have invaded on your peace by this intrusion but my
eternal safety depended on your believing me innocent and faithful
a little while and i shall be in that grave in which for years you
have believed me to be the storm of passion yields to better thoughts
i will never see flamall if i can help it trust to my word it has
never deceived you and to the god of truth i make my appeal that in
thought word and deed charles duncan was worthy of your love and
will die in the blessed hope of meeting your pure spirit in a world of
permanent joy and peace

as soon as i am assured that this packet is in your possession i shall
quit your neighbourhood and finally leave a country in which as for
noahs dove there is no resting place for my foot but should thy
gentle nature turn aside from the sorrows at hand to follow the hapless
wanderer anew in his painful course remember that

                 though in a bare and rugged way
                 through devious lonely paths i stray
                 thy presence shall my pains beguile
                 the barren wilderness shall smile

think not that i misapply these lines for my god will not refuse the
worship of a heart because still alive to those affections he implanted
there as his most precious gift farewell once more i conjure you by
the tenderness and compassion which this will awaken in your bosom to
banish all regrets thou wast a widow harriet from the hour that
duncans honour received its deadly wound thy vows were absolved from
the hour thou wast taught to believe me capable of deserting thee even
to secure my own life i have no doubts to clear away thou wast in the
hands of a monster and heaven has been merciful in extricating thee
from the snares of vice and infamy which that monster had prepared
for thee

                                               farewell charles duncan

ps judge of my resolution i have heard that flamall is daily expected
at the hall i have heard him execrated as the tyrant who rules there i
have heard my harriet pitied yet will i forbear duncan shall not be
his own avenger for there is a god to whom vengeance belongeth and
he will not be mocked i fly from the temptation of infringing his
sacred rights your peace is the shield which i oppose to my just my
everlasting enmity with this demon again i promise that this hand
shall not be raised against your brother for were it my injuries would
give it strength and justice would guide it once more farewell think
not of the lost charles he is only an atom

lady maclairn in continuation

from the hour that maclairns wife has had this evidence of the triumph
of villainy over a man graced and endowed with every requisite to awe
it and to subject its designs by the power of the virtue inherent in
his soul she has been a stranger to peace

my conscience lulled to repose by the fond hope of being necessary to
your comforts my dear maclairn as being the sharer of your sorrows
and the companion and friend in whose presence you sometimes solaced
your woes and as one whom you ever saw without trouble or disquietude
had ceased to upbraid me for crimes to which i had been betrayed by
the authority of my brother and my own timidity had i in the first
hour listened to my selfreproaches on discovering that i had been
deceived and that there still existed a witness against me able in a
moment to render me the object of your scorn and detestation i should
not have shrunk from an open avowal of the infamy i had incurred for i
felt that the woman who is dishonoured in her own eyes and condemned by
her own conscience can meet with no encrease to her misery from the
contempt of the world but as i was malcolm maclairns mother and the
ostensible guardian of his fathers honour and unsullied name i have
been dumb and have sustained my burden with patience for their sakes

but the time is not far remote when heaven in compassion to my
contrition and sorrows will release me you my beloved maclairn will
acknowledge that i have been faithful and malcolm will honour his
mothers grave with a tear and he will say she has expiated her
offence by her sufferings and has proclaimed that she loved the truth
from which she was so fatally led away by a flamall let me o heaven
depart in this hope or be as though i had never lived to those for
whom i have lived oh spare to them the pang of pronouncing harriet
unworthy of the name of maclairn

i will not my dear lucy hazard a single reflexion on this touching
narrative until the full tide of my compassion is somewhat subsided at
present i am disposed to consider that virtue too rigid which could
condemn a culprit like lady maclairn and to say the truth my heart is
too well disposed to admire and to acquit her you will not therefore
expect any decision in opinion until you hear from me again i shall be
anxious to hear that this packet reaches you in safety believe that
though lady maclairns dear friend i am still your

                                                          rachel cowley

p s mrs allen sends her love she is convinced that miss flint loses
ground




                               chap vii


                              letter lvi
                 from miss cowley to miss hardcastle

i am truly rejoiced my lucy to know that the manuscript is safe in
your hands having had on my spirits a dread of its miscarrying you
know not the comfort you administered to poor lady maclairn by your
letter of saturdays post she suspected by my lenity that i was but a
poor casuist in matters of conscience and that i was more solicitous to
banish her sorrows than to probe the cause from which they spring but
since you agree with me in asserting that it is your decided opinion
there can be no criminality in a concealment which secures to the
innocent peace and security i find she listens to me with more
confidence and i hope in time to convince her that to disclose a
secret which cannot produce either directly or indirectly any
beneficial effect to those who must on the contrary suffer from such a
disclosure would partake more of folly than wisdom

in this conclusion i am guided by the best light my understanding offers
me moreover i cannot help placing in the balance the whole train of
events which have led astray from the paths of rectitude a mind
constituted like lady maclairns and i am disposed to believe that she
will be exculpated by an unerring judge for those deviations to which
she has been betrayed by the treachery and oppression of others more
culpable than herself although falsehood is never to be excused yet
the caution of wisdom may surely suggest without a crime the
reasonableness and utility of suppressing that truth which ought not
to be spoken at all times the produce which regulates our zeal and
imposes silence is no violation of truth these are my arguments with
poor lady maclairn i even go farther lucy for i insist that she has
for years been practising the most heroic virtues by suffering in
silence to preserve the peace and tranquillity of her husband and son

but my dear friend if such be the penalty annexed to the concealment
of error and duplicity by an ingenuous mind even when that concealment
is qualified by the powerful motives of preserving the peace and
interest of all around us what i ask must be the horrors of the mind
which covers with a veil of darkness the fraud intended to ruin the
innocent to betray the unsuspecting and to defraud the ignorant what
must be the state and condition of those whose life is a lie i cannot
form a more appalling idea of a state of future punishment than in the
contemplation of the hypocrites terrors even in this life what must be
the life of a person whom deceit and treachery have made responsible
for his safety to a confederate as depraved and dishonest as himself
living under the dread of the chance of every moment for open detection
harassed with the conviction that a more immediate interest or more
specious promises will convert the sharer of his crimes into an
informer and accuser whom he dares not confront what can equal the
pang which must at times pierce his bosom when he recollects that he
enjoys the confidence and favour of his fellow creatures only because
they do not know him for a monster to be shunned but i must check this
train of thought

lady maclairn thanks you for your soothing letter her mind is relieved
by the participation of its burden she can now to use her own words
live without devouring her griefs lest they should be seen sir murdoch
smiles and tells her she is his rival with rachel cowley we shall yet
be more comfortable i trust

i enclose for your amusement and marys perusal a letter we received
on monday from mr serge well may this poor man apply to himself the
words of the son of sirach

the father waketh for the daughter when no man knoweth and the care
for her taketh away sleep when she is young lest she pass away the
flower of her age and being married lest she should be hated i only
regret that mr serge did not study the same author or at least one as
wise for the means to prevent the watchfulness and parental anxiety so
admirably described in the above mentioned words for had he understood
better how to chuse a wife he might have slept in peace a woman
without understanding can hardly be called a virtuous woman and we well
know the price of a virtuous woman is far above rubies

miss flint goes on deplorably her sufferings have subdued the baronet
who sees with augmenting admiration the unremitting attentions of his
excellent harriet even malcolm relents and this morning most
cordially wished his mother to urge her to send for advice to london
thinking her case a chirurgical one

i am growing somewhat displeased with the winds and waves but i
remember canute and submit to a power which i cannot control mrs
allen sends her love she is constantly engaged with her invalid miss
flint is not easy without her

                                            i remain faithfully yours
                                                    rachel cowley


                              letter lvii
               jeremiah serge to sir murdoch maclairn

 my dear friend                  putney oct 

i am certain if you knew the consolation i have in your counsels and
advice you would rejoice for it is the command of a master we both
wish to serve and obey that the strong help the weak god knows i am
weak and my talents few you are a chosen servant to whom many are
intrusted but yet sir murdoch we are of the same household and the
children of the same father and blessed be god you do not like some
men scorn the relationship because one is appointed to a lower station
than another by that wisdom which will accept the lowest who
performs what is required of him i am again brought to the trial of my
strength by a new sorrow from which my good friend neither my money
nor my wisdom can altogether shelter me yet both shall be tried as
the means of relief for both have their use when in the discharge of
that duty which i am bound to perform as a christian parent my
daughter caroline encourages me to open my heart to you she says she
will be answerable for the event for that sir murdoch maclairn is a
man as well as a baronet and that he will feel as a father the
troubles of a father and she is sure that you will approve of my
conduct i think also that you will for i have been governed by her
and surely heaven in its mercy has preserved her life for my good and
has arrested the hand of death until she was more than ripe for the
blessed state prepared for her such a child and yet so wise so good
i cannot proceed

i have taken up my pen again it is only five oclock and not a soul
stirring in the house but myself so i will try and disburthen my mind a
littlei do not now remember whether i told you that some few weeks
since mrs tomkins after passing a day or two with my dear child
during her mothers absence from home took lydia to town with her her
dear sister thinking as she told me that the poor girl was losing her
spirits i knowing that she thought of every ones comforts consented
to my good friends wish of showing lydia some kindness the very
evening they left us caroline turned her discourse on nora praising
the letters she had written to us and with her perfect charity hoping
all things i do not repent my good child said i of the kindness i
have shown her i am not the poorer nor the worse man if i have
purchased with seven thousand pounds the gratitude of one on whom she
depends for the comfort of her life would to god that i could purchase
health for you she smiled and said then indeed would you be in
danger of a bankruptcy for i believe my father would give his last
shilling for his childrens benefit but let this pass my health is not
at present what troubles me promise me my dear father that should
lydia stand in need of your support you will remember that where
much is given much may justly be required but that where nothing
has been sown we cannot reasonably except an harvest to rise make
your mind easy in regard to her replied i thinking she had in her
thoughts the little favour lydia stands in with her mother i pity and
love her i understand what you mean and i promise you i will be her
father and her mother too when occasion serves she shall not be
browbeaten and neglected as she has been of late alas my dear
father answered caroline you must promise more or i cannot die in
peace you must promise to forgive another offending child you must
promiseshe threw her arms around me sir murdoch and weeping added
to shelter her from reproach and shame i turned faint and giddy and
my daughter gave me her salts oh if you could but have heard what she
said you would not wonder at what i have done in a word my child was
satisfied and she lives to tell me again that she was going to a
heavenly father from one who imitated him in lenity to his offending
offspring there was in her look something which poured joy and
comfort into my broken heart i only wish i could go to heaven with her

well i saw my weak unhappy girl and mrs tomkins advised me to let
her manage for she was certain the terror of seeing her mother would be
fatal to her and the unborn infant i could not reproach her sir
murdoch indeed an afflicted man is not an angry man and after
all had not i been deficient in my duty has not my indolent temper
and love of peace been more considered than the good of my family i
have been too passive sir murdoch too indulgent

i found the young spark who had taken lydias fancy was william who
was with us at fairfield hall and whom we all liked as a very sober
well behaved young man his sister my wifes favourite maid introduced
him to us some time before we went to bath she said he was like many
foolish young men tired of being remote from temptation and that he
had gained with much difficulty her fathers consent to seek a place
in london as a valet or a butler being well qualified for both she
was quite unhappy that he should be left to his own guidance till he was
fixed in a sober family seeing he was a very likely young man and
quite a stranger so my wife who never is behind hand in good nature
said he might come to putney and we were well pleased with him and
engaged him to attend us to bath poor lydia has been honest with mrs
tomkins the young fellow was not so much in fault as herself she
confessed that she sought him however this was not the question with
me we might perhaps have hushed up this business such things are done
as they say every day but what follows a crime in my opinion ten
times worse than lydias being as it were committed in cool blood
for what can be more dishonest than passing off a deluded girl for a
chaste one and depriving a poor innocent babe of a father and a name
i could not do such an act of injustice being convinced that it would
be doing what i should not think just in another to do by me

i consulted our friend counsellor steadman however on this vexatious
business for notwithstanding i have little to be proud of as one may
say yet it went some how to my heart that a child of mine should be
pointed at by scorn and derision he is a worthy and a wise man and
agrees with mr tomkins that the best thing i can do is to let these
young simpletons be married the girl being half distracted with the
fear of losing sight of william and he being willing to take her as he
told the friend we employed mrs tomkinss mother that he would work
for her to his lifes end and show his good master that it was not his
money he wished for i find his parents are honest people though low in
the world they had a farm within six miles of york but by losses
amongst their cattle things went backward and being in arrears for rent
when their lease expired they lost the farm william was then about
eighteen had received good learning and was a sober steady lad but a
little pride made him discontented and he did not like to work as a
gardener in a piece of ground which his father cultivated in that way
near york and which as he says in excuse for his leaving his parents
could only produce a maintenance for them and that he was only a burden
on the ground so all was fixed for the marriage and we thought no time
was to be lost

i am not quite pleased with my wife sir murdoch although i know she is
as harmless as an infant yet it grieves me to see that she will always
be an infant she was absent a whole month from putney and whilst
caroline was thus employed and thus disturbed she was taking her
pleasure with people she knew nothing of and whom all honest and sober
minded persons would shun during eight days she waited forsooth for
the captain who could not think it proper for mrs serge to travel
without an escort as he calls a puppy i remembered the time when much
younger she could travel by land and by water without such a conundrum
in her head however they arrived here and the captain to my great
satisfaction refused to lodge with us pleading business in town and
intending to be absent only three days from his nora and his friends

i shall say nothing of my poor wifes hysterics when i told her how
matters stood with lydia she was terribly bad indeed but thank god
these fits are not dangerous as the doctors say and experience seems
to justify them in their opinion for i know one of my wifes old
friends who has been subject to them twenty years no sooner had my
poor lydia got the better of hers on this trying occasion than she
lamented her hard case saying with many tears and much anger that she
should never be able to shew her face again amongst fashionable people
and that no one but myself would ever have thought of sinking their
family by such a dunghill connexion i lost my temper sir murdoch
for it frets a man to be always doing for the best and who is said
never to do right and i very roundly told her that all the plagues of
my life were owing to fashionable people as she called gamblers and
pickpockets and if added i that were all the mischief i should be
tempted to thank william willet for his good services you have now
continued i been a month under a roof which the honest would shun
whilst under your own mrs serge the prop and stay of my life is
sinking to the grave you might have learned a lesson of more value than
what your fashionable people at reveland park have been teaching you
she looked confounded and wept in silence no man loves peace more than
i do my heart relented and i only added that she knew this was my
temper that whatever i thought or rather felt to be right that i
would do and that the following morning lydia would be mrs willet i
kept my word sir murdoch and last thursday by means of a licence i
saw the young couple united i do not know how it was but they quite
softened me by their tears and thanks mrs tomkins was so good as to
accompany them to her mothers they set out as soon as the ceremony was
over and i returned to putney to dinner contented and relieved in my
mind on entering the parlour i found my fashionable soninlaw there
he was reading the newspaper and i asked him by way of saying
something what news none replied he of importance but i
understand sir we may expect a curious article tomorrow he smiled
and as i thought insolently adding miss lydia serge second
daughter to jeremiah serge esq married to william willet late butler
and gardener at putney in her fathers house will make a curious
paragraph very likely answered i gravely and the article may
farther say that the marriage ceremony was performed in st martins
church by the minister of the parish and in the presence of the
brides father i shall contentedly leave to the public their opinions
some may be found who will perceive nothing wonderful in a marriage
between serge the taylors daughter and willet the farmers son
you are to judge for yourself sir replied he but i conceive few
will think miss lydias character redeemed by this twofold disgrace to
herself and family upon my honour i pity mrs serge and i dread the
effects of this intelligence on mrs fairly look ye captain
answered i neither your mode nor william willets of getting a
footing in my family has been such as will make either of you my
counsellors or guides i shall act as i please do as i please but as i
am a just man be it your case so to conduct yourself as to make it
pleasant to me to be your friend my children except one who is
too good for this miserable world have both chosen for themselves the
same lenity has been employed for the one whom weakness has betrayed to
folly as to the other whom vanity and presumption rendered ungrateful
and disobedient i hope sir returned he with a fierce air you do
not pretend to compare we will do what is better answered i
ringing the bell we will drop the enquiry and have our dinner my
gentleman was surprised i believe by my manner he took the hint
however and followed me to the dining parlour our meal was not a
cheerful one and i went to my dear girl the moment the cloth was
withdrawn

i see sir murdoch how things are turning my wife is cajoled and
flattered by this fellow to such a degree as would surprise you she
fancies he has done her a great favour by running away with her
daughter poor soul it will be well if he does not run away with her
simple understanding however all these troubles call upon me for
diligence in the settling my worldly concerns as well as those for
another and a better state i have already spoke to counsellor
steadman on this subject my property is very considerable and much
caution is necessary in the disposal of it so as to render it a
lasting benefit to my family now my good sir murdoch i think
nothing would give me more comfort in my last hour i believe it is not
far distant than to know that i had left you and my dear friend mr
malcolm with mr steadman guardians and trustees for the support of the
ignorant and helpless and a wall of defence for the innocents who may
spring from my daughters imprudent marriages i am led to hope that you
will not refuse me this kindness you shall hear from the counsellor
when all is prepared he has been my right hand lately i am directed by
him in all that relates to williams settlement but lydia shall have
the same allowance as nora and we are on the lookout for something for
her husband

                                     god preserve you all in health
                                             prays your faithful friend
                                                     jeremiah serge

p s my wife begs to be remembered she is out of spirits and fancies
the air of putney unwholesome my caroline is a miracle it is
astonishing to think how nature is supported i am far from being well
you will not wonder at this

                             letter lviii
                 from miss cowley to miss hardcastle

it is with no small satisfaction my dearest lucy that i find my
enthusiasm of mind and ardency of temper to avail myself of your
gentle terms for a spirit too often governed by the impulse of a heart
which in its promptitude is apt to take the lead of judgment have met
with your approbation and concurrence in regard at least to the
conduct i mean to pursue with lady maclairn to say the truth lucy i
could practise no other for she hourly rises in my estimation and
esteem with me is the basis of affection the relief which she finds
in communicating her thoughts to me has given to her very language a
frankness which appears to be her natural character and in her account
of the various occurrences of her life since she married sir murdoch
she omits not even her conjectures as these arose from the
circumstances in which she has been placed i long since had proofs
said she this morning when speaking of the suffering miss flint that
lucretia was not devoid of feeling my brother for reasons of his own
had so contrived it that she firmly held an opinion which he it is
probable only affected to have illegitimate birth he considered as
an indelible disgrace on the innocent and miss flint adopted this
notion firmly believing that neither fortune talents nor even virtue
could screen an unfortunate being who stood in this predicament from
the reproach and insults of the malicious her affection for her child
was unbounded and i saw with comfort that i had at least gained her
gratitude by my apostacy from truth the conduct she maintained with my
brother in the mean time puzzled me it was obvious he was no longer
the favoured lover and one day observing philip much disturbed from
an interview he had with her in the garden at kensington i ventured to
say to lucretia that i was sorry to see philip unhappy i understand
you replied she and i will be explicit with you i shall never be
his wife nor will i be to him what i unfortunately have been i am a
mother harriet and i will prove myself one by remaining what i am
and what i can contrive to be the guardian of my son i have no
passions to gratify no desires to control since i beheld the face of
my child to love and cherish him and to bless you for your goodness
shall fill up the measure of my miserable days she burst into tears
and left me abruptly her sincerity wanted no evidence stronger than her
conduct continued lady maclairn for some time all went well i was
made happy through her mediation and amongst the delusive hopes which
led me to farefield hall as maclairns wife was the flattering one
that by the influence i had acquired over lucretia i might in time
reconcile her to mrs howard mr flamall frustrated these designs his
affections as a parent were so artfully so effectually brought
forward and his conduct was so specious that lucretia insensibly gave
him a confidence which as gradually subjected her to his will and
pleasure as myself and she observed that nature had yet preserved one
strong hold in flamalls bosom for that he loved his child and that
would prove to her a source of future comfort for that no man was more
capable of the office of preceptor even i assented to this opinion
miss cowley as it related to his talents and i was still the dupe of
that affection which nature had interwoven with my frame for my
brother he became more serious and reserved from the hour of philips
birth and in the regularity of his conduct and the instances i had of
his growing parsimony i scrupled not to think that he was a changed man
in many respects although still unsubdued in his love of power as
philip became of an age to receive his lessons his visits at the hall
might be called a residence but you know already how little these
visits were productive of comfort to me and i may likewise add of
comfort to miss flint for my brother was a rigid disciplinarian and
had not the childs temper been one of the most docile and sweet he
would have been miserable for my brother guided by his acquaintance
with vice understood not that the path to virtue is pleasant and to
unperverted feet and a pure heart has allurements far superior to any
that his lectures and vigilance could furnish

you may judge of the difficulties i had to encounter in this period of
my life and the condition to which i was reduced by a brothers
reminding me from time to time that it was best for me to be
prudent there was little need of a conscience like mine to draw the
inference his tone and manner were sufficient and he repeatedly roused
lucretia to stand forth as my champion on a ground which had made me a
coward and the slave of the wretch who had led me into the crooked
path her conduct was at least uniformly generous on this point
continued lady maclairn she never directly nor indirectly mentioned
duncan nor did i till very lately know to what extent her knowledge
went of this unhappy affair i breathed like one freed from death when
i found that mr flamall had determined to leave england with philip
from the time i had the unfortunate mr duncans narrative before me my
soul abhorred the sight of my brother and i so entirely secluded myself
in my husbands apartment that we did not meet twice in a week and his
reserve and coldness when we did went not beyond mine again my dear
miss cowley truth obliges me to give a good report of miss flint in
proportion as my spirits flagged she redoubled her attention to my
wants and her purse was ever open to me i believe that my brothers
reason for going to jamaica originally sprung from a serious quarrel
with lucretia the death of his wicked wife left him free to marry and
he was very pressing on that subject with miss flint lucretia had her
secrets as well as myself but accident led me within reach of hearing
her say never urge me no further for by all that is sacred if you
do percival shall know all i retreated fearing to be discovered
and from that time his voyage was mentioned as a decided matter after
my brothers departure lucretia fatigued me with her importunities to
draw me from my husbands room i should have a servant to watch him
and one i could rely on although it cost her an hundred pounds per
annum i was firm and she submitted left to herself she thought of
her niece and i was consulted on the expediency of her inviting this
poor girl to live with her i was distressed for a reply knowing the
bitter resentment which she had nourished even to the name of howard
and her hatred to those who had sheltered this unfortunate and excellent
couple i evaded the question as well as i could contenting myself with
observing that i had always thought it an act of duty on her part to
take care of her niece i am willing to do so answered she colouring
but i must first know what she is good for and whether the people with
whom she lives have not taught her to believe i am a monster i saw the
rising storm and timidly shrunk from it saying that i could not give
her my advice without incurring the censure of being swayed by a sordid
consideration for my reputed son but you know added i that you can
provide for both these young people and you must determine their
respective claims poor mary soon after exchanged her abode of peace
for this and the event has confirmed my fears the gentle and timid
mary neither gained spirits here nor strove to amuse her aunts she
had but one path it was to submit in silence to her aunts temper and
to anticipate her commands by her diligence she soon perceived the
fatal habit which lucretia indulged and this produced terror and
disgust in her innocent mind which as you will believe did not tend
to conciliate her to her aunts hardships i did all that i could do to
soften the one and encourage the other but my interference was
resented and i was reproached as being allied to her enemies and
blinded by malcolm to favour the heartleys

i was tempted lucy to hazard some questions with a direct reference
to sir murdochs suspicion of having been poisoned but a moments
reflection checked my curiosity and i diverted her attention from
perceiving my embarrassment by asking her whether she knew what was
become of the gentlemans portrait and the papers which so obviously
appeared to have belonged to mr duncans story she unaffectedly
answered that sir murdoch had when in london to meet me consigned
them into the hands of the spanish minister then resident there and in
the interview added she he learned that this nobleman was not
totally a stranger to the fate of duncans parents they were dead and
a distant branch of the family was in possession of the title and
immense estate but there was a sister of the duke still living who was
abbess of a convent and to her he engaged to deliver these melancholy
memorials of her still adored brother can you wonder miss cowley
continued she with emotion that i wish for death think of my
meditations when darkness and repose conceal me from all eyes but those
of a merciful being who witnesses my agonies such has been the ruin
effected by a wretch i dare not curse he is the child of my parents
the ties of blood still flow around my heart and i implore heavens
sparing mercy for him whilst my soul sickens at the thought of the
injuries his hands have wrought and which no time nor repentance can
remedy think of his dreadful account with outraged humanity violated
truth and every law of justice i endeavour to hope that charles has
found his peaceful grave i dream of him and this frame of mind lays me
open to superstition my imagination presents him as exultingly
hovering over me on angels wings smiling with ineffable complacency
and beckoning me to follow him i try to obey him and awake trembling
such are the visions of my sleeping hours you need not be told the
meditations of my waking ones one single principle of action has
counteracted the fatal effects of these perturbations i love my
husband my dear miss cowley with an affection exclusively his and i
wish to live whilst that life is useful to him i am prepared for the
event of being hateful to his eyes god will have compassion on me

my tears composed her and my arguments were listened to she promised
me to be all i wished and i broke up the conversation by proposing a
walk in the avenue her husband joined us there and i told him i had
been chiding my mother he smiled tenderly and placed himself between
us observing that he would keep the peace you will not succeed
replied i with assumed gaiety nor will i accept of you for an ally
you are too much like your wife but i have blustered her already into
obedience to my will and she had promised to be good and to walk with
me every day the sun shines instead of sitting in miss flints room to
hear of pains which she cannot alleviate he thanked her and blessed
your

                              letter lix
                 from miss cowley to miss hardcastle

i am glad you agree with me in thinking it proper that our dear mary
should know the doctors opinion of her aunts precarious life she has
consented with great reluctance to see doctor tufton he confirms our
fears and has made no change in her medicines she told douglass that
she hoped he was satisfied by her compliance with his wishes and added
do not think i am to be deceived i have done with medicines and
doctors i told her that in that case i should think myself dismissed
from her presence as well as favour said the doctor she answered
that the visits of a friend would still be useful and acceptable but
added she dejectedly your prescriptions may not be more infallible for
a sick mind than a diseased body i took her burning hand continued
the good doctor and with sincerity of heart i told her that in both
my characters as her physician and as her friend i still hoped to be
salutary to her on condition she did not desert herself you are too
low now added i pouring out an untasted cordial at my hand you ought
to have taken this two hours since she put the cup aside and shaking
her head said you know it will do me no good these are not the
cordials i need i know there are others within your reach replied i
with seriousness that would contribute to give efficacy to this and
which you refuse from a despondency of mind which you ought to check
wherefore is it that with a brother nigh you and whose conversation
would cheer you you refuse to see him his heart is melting with
compassion at the intelligence of your dejection and sufferings why
then does he not come and tell me so asked she with agitation but i
know what keeps him at a distance he cannot say lucretia i forgive
you he cannot say be comforted

the offence which produced your intemperance and his too warm
resentment has been fully expiated by the pain which both have
experienced from it observed the doctor both were in fault and both
have regretted the fault percival thinks only of a sick and afflicted
sister i will pledge my life on the sincerity of his affection for
you and i know his soul seeks to meet you in peace and love she was
oppressed and gasped for utterance oh why does he delay said she
i long to see him before i die you shall see him to day replied i
on condition that you will be composed i am confident that you will
find comfort and amusement from his society she named the hour and
requested that i would come with him not knowing how the sight of him
might affect her i thought it better to avoid the suspense of
procrastinating the interview continued the doctor and mr flint has
been with her poor percival was extremely shocked when he saw the
alteration that sickness had made in her person she gave him her hand
and told him with more composure than i expected that she took his
visit kindly he spoke with emotion and said something of his hopes
and the ensuing summer i shall not live to see it answered she
looking stedfastly on him but it will comfort you percival to know
that the prospect of the grave no longer terrifies me i am not without
hope he interrupted her cherish it said he eagerly and kissing her
cheek cherish it my dear lucretia and may its salutary influence
restore your health as well as your peace is this your wish replied
she bursting into tears do you can you forgive me you had not seen
me here lucretia answered the captain with solemnity had any
resentment lurked in my bosom as i hope for pardon for my own errors
and mistakes so certain is it that affection and compassion brought me
hither forget as i have done the past live to be my comfort and may
this hour cancel from your mind every thought that retards your
recovery he again kissed her and she hung on his neck groaning with
her agitations percival overcome by this scene permitted me to lead
him from the chamber and he was not able to see the family i parted
with him in the avenue my patient fatigued by these exertions is
fallen into a dose she is sinking gradually and will probably be
lethargic

mary will be anxious to hear the result of this first interview her
aunt requested that the captain would visit her daily

i have only time to sign the name of your

                                                          rachel cowley

p s has alice informed you that mr snughead is dead either his
soninlaws return or his grief for his wife was too much for him he
died at bath of the gout in his stomach


                               letter lx
                      from the same to the same

our good father has no doubt communicated to mary the news of her uncle
oliver flints death peace to his manes he has left behind him a good
report and we are much pleased with the last proof of his being an
honest and friendly man his heir mr philip flint has written a very
handsome letter to the captain to inform him of his legacy of five
thousand pounds and marys of three adding that believing it was the
intention of the donor that there should be no delay in the payment of
these bequests he had transmitted to him the first six months interest
of the sum in order to answer the present unavoidable retardment of the
principal sum whilst waiting for his precise orders mr flamall still
remains obdurate a circumstance which mr philip flint in his letter to
his mother regrets as a drawback on his comforts and peculiarly
oppressive to his mind at a time when he might have been useful as a
consoler

there were letters for miss flint from mr flamall and her brother some
precautions were judged requisite in regard to the delivery of these
doctor douglass undertook the business as well as to prepare her for
the sable dress of the captain he asked her how long her brother oliver
had left england she took this hint and replied with calmness that he
had been dead to her more than thirty years but added she sighing
when we are reunited this period will appear nothing encouraged by
her composure he proceeded to mention his honourable acquittal of his
promise to mr philip flint and the regrets of his friends for his
loss and giving her the letters destined for her was on the point of
retiring after recommending to her to be careful of fatiguing her
spirits remain a moment replied she taking the two letters you
shall see that i mean to preserve my tranquillity this comes from a
hand that never administered to me aught but comfortshe placed mr
flints letter under her pillow this from a man who miserable in
himself is the common disturber of the peace of others i will not read
his letter put it into the fire i hesitated in obeying her
continued the doctor she perceived it and tore it into fragments
now burn them and judge said she that i can be firm mr flamall has
nothing to do with this hour i will not be disturbed by his
resentments she paused and saw the mutilated letter consumed i shall
not have the comfort my brother oliver had observed she but i do not
murmur percival is very kind to me tell him that i am calm and
composed but that i shall be busy to day and cannot see him and send
lady maclairn hither

it appears that her ladyships commission was to send off an express to
durham for an attorney whom miss flint named mary will have a letter
from the captain tomorrow i am going to pass the day at the abbey sir
murdoch droops a little he dreads the consequence of his wifes
perpetual fatigue she has a cough not very pleasant to my ears

mrs allen is of great use to the invalid she regulates the sick room
with her usual address and has convinced miss flint of the utility of
quitting her bed for the sopha during some part of the day she thinks
it refreshes her spirits and some interval of ease at present enables
her to make the exertion

                                           i remain lucys affectionate

                              letter lxi
                      from the same to the same

this letter will contain little beyond the particulars of a scene which
recently passed in miss flints room our dear marys solicitude is
unavoidable and her wish to know what passes here ought to be indulged

mrs allen was requested to witness the signing of miss flints will
she cheerfully complied douglass and mrs warner joining with her

when this business was terminated she requested the doctor to inform
the captain that she wished to see him after dinner and with a languid
smile she added tell him that mrs allen shall give him his coffee

when alone with our friend she begged of her to be the witness to the
conversation she meditated on for the evening do not refuse me
continued she i have a few instructions to leave with my brother and
you will be useful you will hear nothing to grieve you although it
may affect him and flatter me but i wish to finish my business with
this world

the captain in mrs allens words was punctual to his time his sister
was on the sopha but looked flushed and fatigued he was agitated
continued mrs allen and i said we are doing well to day sir he
took his seat by her and pressed her offered hand with his lips she
immediately spoke of mr oliver flints death making some obvious
reflexions on the event then suddenly looking at her brothers dress
she said i hope percival you do not mourn that poor oliver has given
to a brother who stood by him as a son an inheritance that ought in the
eye of justice to have been yours the captain coloured and replied
with eagerness that he was perfectly contented with the proofs he had
received of his brothers consideration he has rendered me comfortable
added he for the remainder of my life and has placed mary in a
condition fully adequate to her ambition i am grateful and sincerely
hope that philip flint will live to show the world he was worthy of the
man whom he has succeeded miss flint was softened to tears god grant
said she with emotion that my will may be thus satisfactory to you i
have done for the best percival i have been governed by only one
principle let me die in the hope that you will accept it as an evidence
of my repentance for having so long overlooked your just claimsshe
spoke this with agony

my dear lucretia said the captain hastily and startled at the disorder
she was in let us drop a subject so useless i have no wants no wishes
ungratified but that of seeing you well i cannot bear your kindness
replied the poor weeping miss flint i have not deserved it say not so
to me answered the brother with tenderness we have all my dear
sister to make this acknowledgment to our maker we have all of us
errors to regret and something for contrition but we have a merciful
judge who knows that we are weak and fallible let me conjure you to
endeavour to recover your spirits let us employ the allotted space
allowed us in acts of love and mutual aid your friend as well as
physician assures me that your malady is augmented by the depression
of your mind exert your faith animate your spirits by reflecting that
you are in the hands of a being infinite in mercy would you like to
have mary with you she wishes to see you and might be useful to you i
could not bear to see her answered miss flint with a voice broken by
sorrow but it is not from unkindness that i reject her it is not
hatred nor cruelty that govern me i am certain it is not replied the
captain no my dear sister their empire is over and a temper to
which worlds would be nothing in the balance has now a place in your
heart oh live to enjoy the blessed exchange live for my comfort

i thought his sister must have fainted continued mrs allen wiping
the tears of sympathy from her honest face and i hinted that she wanted
her cordial the captain understood me and i believe would have gladly
retired himself and left her to my care for he rose and observed he
had staid too long and that she needed rest rest repeated she
detaining him oh be not so deceived i need no rest i can find none
that cheers me like seeing you he again took his seat and with
composure observed that she had promised him coffee and that he would
remain on condition she would try to be quiet and listen to our chat
she smiled and i took my post

again he offered to leave her when with composure she said my dear
percival you must indulge me this is the last time i will mention
business which may distress you but i shall not be easy until i have
finally settled my concerns with this world whatever you find done in
this way when i am dead remember what i have already said i have done
all in love and have been as just as i could be to you you will find
my will in that cabinet continued she directing his attention to it
lady maclairn has my instructions in respect to all that it contains
except the will she will inspect it in your presence

here is a present for my niece may it prove to her what of late it has
been to me a blessing the captain paced the room in silence this
picture my dear and invaluable friend continued she addressing me
you will see buried with me she gazed intently on the miniature of mr
philip flint which she wears in her bosom poor fellow added she
mournfully he will not soon forget lucretia he will regret that he was
not with mei cannot stand this said the agitated captain and were i
not convinced lucretia that even in this depression of your mind
there is a healing power more potent than all human aids you would
break my hearti will spare your feelings answered she only let me
say a few words more i wish to have your concurrence i have nominated
mr greenwood to succeed snughead in the farefield living but if you
think he would like the presentation better from you speak and it
shall be so managed i do not believe added mrs allen that the
captain could have uttered a word had his friends being made an
archbishop depended on it he was quite overcome by his feelings

at length he ventured to say should you like to see mr greenwood he
would be sorry to see me replied she he is a good man and will pity
me but i wish not to see him i have no want of his assistance she
raised her eyes to heaven and paused you may imagine continued mrs
allen that her exertions had subdued her the captain no sooner left
her than she went to her bed and i have the comfort of quitting her in
a peaceful sleep

this recital my lucy will affect poor mary but it will do her no harm
hereafter her mind wants firmness for the trials of life and she must
acquire strength by the usual means i have occasion for more patience
and fortitude than i possess i tremble for the consequences which will
result to mrs allen should miss flint continue long in her present
condition what will you say to the cares and attention that devote my
dear friend to her room the whole day what will you say to her swelled
legs got by watching her through half the night will it be any comfort
to you when she is on a sick bed to be told that her piety and prayers
are the cordials that quiet the perturbed spirit of the miserable
invalid i have yet much to do with my rebellious one and i honestly
confess that sincerely as i rejoice at miss flints present temper of
mind i should murmur to give a saint to her funeral obsequies my
serious remonstrances have answered mrs allen is gone to bed and i
will take care she shall not quit it tonight to traverse half clothed
the passages to that of another

what with fogs within and fogs without it has been necessary for me to
make a sun of my own sir murdoch has undertaken to teach me to paint in
oil colours and i have begun to copy a landscape trs riant for i
cannot help laughing at my imitation of a good copy

in continuation

i was summoned below stairs the enclosed will explain the cause sir
murdoch and his son set out for putney tomorrow morning and we are in
a bustle and somewhat anxious about the roads and cold weather i
must help lady maclairn in this alarm

                                                          adieu yours
                                                              r cowley

               from mr serge to sir murdoch maclairn

                                                       putney dec 

my dear and honoured friend it is all over with jeremiah serge the
public papers will tell you that he is desolate tomorrow i shall lose
sight of her precious remains but what of that do i not see her always
before me do i not hear her voice and the blessed consolations she
gave me my name was in the last sigh that conveyed her to her god oh
she was a child sir murdoch worthy of a heavenly father she was too
good to be lent me long and yet i never forgot to be grateful for the
loan my daily prayers were thanks to god for the blessings she
imparted so affectionate so gentle so wise and yet so young what a
bulwark of defence has my age and weakness lost i do not know why i
write to you but i am so oppressed by my thoughts and my kind friends
here fatigue me they cannot help it they do for the best but what can
be done for me is it not hard to see the sapless trunk left to the
wintry blasts and the blossoms of the spring cut off if my child had
been spared only a little while she might have closed my eyes and i
had been at rest but i must not murmur against god my caroline warned
me not to grieve as one without hope and i will hope sir murdoch
that my present feelings will soon effect my deliverance i shall soon
be reunited to my child i am very ill and i think it is better to
tell you what also disturbs me in this hour of tribulation before i send
away this letter i have not been negligent in regard to my worldly
concerns as these relate to the security of my wife and children for i
lost no time in executing that duty after you had so graciously
consented to be my childrens friend but my heart is now set upon
seeing you and malcolm once more before i die you are a good man sir
murdoch and in the sight of god that is the only title that will
survive you i think you will not refuse to come to me no comfort on
earth would be so welcome but do not delay your journey if you mean to
see me for indeed i am sinking fast my poor wife is on a sick bed she
might have foreseen the blow more than she did but we have all our
faults poor soul she finds at this hour that life needs more than a
doublet of silk to guard the pilgrim in his rough journey i am sure
malcolm will second me in my request tell him that poor caroline spoke
of him not an hour before she died and called him her good brother
malcolm

  god preserve you sir murdoch from knowing the sorrow which fills the
    heart of

                 from miss cowley to miss hardcastle

                                                       friday morning

my letter of monday last contained the intelligence of the good
baronets safety and the comfortable hopes that are entertained at
putney that mr serge will not need executors to his will for some
time at least for the sight of the travellers has been a cordial to
him this morning we had another letter it was from malcolm all the
business which occasioned the journey had been finished to poor mr
serges contentment but he had exerted himself too much and the gout
had overtaken him malcolm adds that the doctor regards this
indisposition as favourable to his friends general health and that he
is chief nurse mrs fairly attends her mother with assiduity though
unwell herself she is he says the shadow of the leonora we know and
he thinks her in a consumption her husband from time to time attends
her but his reception is cold and ceremonious in mr serges room and
he is not less restrained on his part with the guests sir murdoch is in
perfect health and the counsellor shares in his leisure hours and
contributes to his amusement

lady maclairn summons me to perform my part of the task we have before

                              letter lxiv

                                                       sunday morning

will my lucy need from me the obvious reflexions which will result from
the perusal of this letter no nor have i time to make them though
the impressions on my mind are such as will indelibly remain as
admonitions to warn me against too much security in this worlds air
bubbles

i had so well sustained my part with my pen in writing to sir murdoch
that i had produced a cheerfulness on the pensive brow of his wife and
she detained me with her until it was too late to finish my letter to
you i therefore continued to read and chat with my friend till near the
dining hour the appearance of doctor douglass was nothing new but we
were equally struck with his manner and countenance and her ladyship
with alarm asked him whether lucretia was worse no replied he
with visible distress there is no material change but she has asked
for you lady maclairn immediately quitted us to go to her sisters
room she is dying observed i you think so i am certain why do
you flatter lady maclairn with hopes poor creature answered he i
wish she had only this shock to support there would then be little to
justify my fears for her but i am a coward miss cowley and you must
assist me and yet i tremble even in soliciting your aid for these
exertions can do you no good never think of me said i eagerly
what are the dreadful tidings you bring that a sinner is departed
answered he with solemnity that lady maclairn has no longer a brother
let me conduct you to your apartment continued he seeing me pale and
trembling i must consult you and we shall be interrupted here i
made no reply but yielded to his assistance

a burst of tears relieved me wherefore is it observed poor douglass
with compassion that you seem destined by providence to be the
support of this unfortunate family and by the continual exertions of
your fortitude and humanity thus to diminish your own comforts and
weaken your health i admire you and i reverence your mrs hardcastle
but your strength of mind is uncommon try it replied i let me hear
the whole of this dreadful affair it cannot be worse than i apprehend
nor is it better answered he and we have to guard against
surprises it must be discovered the public papers will have the
intelligence and lady maclairn must be prepared are you equal to the
task i trust i am answered i otherwise my strength of mind is no
virtue he grasped my hand and said some words expressive of his
approbation then proceeded to inform me that captain flint had found
on his table the preceding evening on returning from his sisters the
packet which he now produced i was sent for added the doctor and
we passed nearly the whole night in reading the contents and consulting
the best means of communicating them to lady maclairn the captain
declared he was unable to do it and thought himself peculiarly
disqualified for the office it being no secret that he despised the
man and was not surprised at his end i have no heart on such
occasions continued douglass rising and pacing the room i have a
trick of looking beyond this diurnal sphere and i hate to announce
the death of the wicked there are the letters i will leave you for an
hour and then return you may want me as a physician

to the hasty perusal of them followed my thanks to providence for the
absence of sir murdoch and without suffering the energy of my mind to
relax i sent for lady maclairn to my room she instantly perceived my
emotion and i at once acknowledged that i had bad news to communicate
from jamaica and which captain flint was unequal to the task of doing
she gasped for breath nothing can equal continued i mr philip
flints solicitude for you thank god he has stood the shock his
friends are without alarm for him mr flamalls death must be
supported my dear lady maclairn let me see you composed it was
sudden said she fixing her eyes on my face it wasi made no other
answer than falling on her shoulder and weeping it is enough said
she trembling and sinking from my embrace i was terrified for she did
not faint as i expected but with her eyes fixed and with a deadly
groan she articulated the name of duncan i immediately perceived the
dreadful idea which had taken possession of her mind he is at rest
my dear friend said i and now blessed for his faithfulness to you
i was proceeding but she heard me not horror had transfixed her to her
seat she was as cold as marble and not a tear fell i rang the bell
with violence the doctor entered at the same moment he instantly bled
her and she was put into my bed douglass watched her under great
uneasiness until she appeared to me to be dead i really thought she
was when her eyes closed and her stiffened limbs relaxed take
courage said he the worst is passed she will recover the event
shewed his judgment for in a few minutes she burst into violent
sobbings and the deathlike coldness of her hand gave place to a
friendly perspiration he gave her a cordial and ordering no one to
disturb her by speaking i was left with her by his orders i neither
checked her tears nor evaded her enquiries i believe however that
she dosed for some time as not a sigh escaped her at length putting
aside the curtain she spoke and i approached her angel of mercy and
goodness said she kissing my hand tell me has no one seen my
distress the servants saw you in a fainting state replied i but
they never saw me so ill i believe observed she with anxiety did
nothing escape me i satisfied her at once on this point and at her
request briefly and i think wisely informed her of the leading events
contained in the captains letters she wept and i proceeded in this
trial of your faith and fortitude said i it is not possible you can
overlook the merciful being who has secured duncan from guilt by
removing him to an abode of peace i cannot express my thankfulness
replied she but i feel the gratitudebut my wretched lost brother
she shuddered anew he is before an unerring judge replied i
interrupting her it neither becomes you nor myself to limit infinite
mercy you are now called upon by that god of mercy to submit to his
power and to trust in his goodness and compassion let it be your
concern to perform with courage the part assigned you it has been a
difficult one but not beyond your strength remember that you are still
a wife and a mother and your duties will give you patience and peace

emulate the man in whose sorrows you have shared he was faithful to
the end deprive him not of the glory of having loved your reputation
and your honour more than his own to lady maclairn he sacrificed his
fondest hopes his vengeance on his oppressor his ease in life and
even the name of her faithful duncan to his last moments weep for him
continued i with my eyes streaming neither religion nor virtue forbid
this tribute to his memory but live to preserve sir murdoch maclairns
peace i would die rather than disturb it said she with agony it is
my misery my past punishment that whilst my soul mourns the fate of a
man ruined by my affection another not less worthy not less beloved
has been involved in all the perils of my miserable condition and
conduct i cannot live without maclairns esteem and tenderness i
cannot die without affecting him i must still wear the odious cloak of
deceit i must still impose on his noble unsuspecting nature oh fatal
consequences of my quitting the paths of truth added she with
interrupted sighs wretched fruits of my weak credulity and childish
fears had i been firm had i shown myself to the world as the
reprobated widow of poor duncan i should long ere this have smiled at
its contempt or been at peace in my grave but for what am i not now
answerable not for your brothers wickedness replied i eagerly
you have a fair account my dear friend to set against the errors of
your youth recollect the place you have filled in society the years of
suffering your tender cares have mitigated the duties of the mother you
have performed the happiness you have administered and i will add the
pangs your courage has sustained in order to effect the tranquillity of
others secresy is now a duty and an obligation enforced upon you by
every motive of virtue and utility let me see you what you may be
unless by recalling the past you destroy your health and my hopes
the storm is passed and if you experience not the joy of an unclouded
sky yet the evening of your days may be serene and quiet

she promised me to be all i wished and to brace every nerve against her
husbands return i think she is more composed to day and at her
request i have been with miss flint as i expected she began by
lamenting her ladyships sudden indisposition and added that percival
also had a cold which prevented her seeing him i gave her hopes of her
sisters speedy recovery and endeavoured to keep up the conversation
but she soon dosed which i find she again does half her time and i
left her without being noticed

good night i am going to bed and to sleep if i can mrs allen will be
with lady maclairn i direct my letters to sedley you will understand
by the accompaniments my reason for so doing mary might wonder at not
being trusted mr sedley will give you this packet adieu let me know
that the intelligence is secure in your hands my friend wishes you to
keep these with the other papers she has read them

i am really quite worn out with one or two nights watching but do not
fancy me sick should i be lazy we expect sir murdoch the day after
tomorrow and i may have too much business on my hands to write to you
before saturday


                              letter lxv
               from mr paget to capt percival flint

                     enclosed in the preceding

 dear sir      kingston jamaica c

the melancholy contents of this letter will sufficiently account for its
being written by a stranger to you the duty assigned to me will
however at once show me the friend of mr flint and the painful
witness of the distress into which all his family are plunged

the sudden death of mr flamall his uncle is an event which under
the common circumstances of human life would require precaution in
the communication of it at farefield hall but my poor friend has to
dread every thing lest the catastrophe of his uncles end should reach
his mother through the channel of the public papers he conjures you to
consult his brother malcolm in those measures which are necessary to
prevent this blow reaching the hall too suddenly for his mothers
strength before i begin the detail of those particulars which you will
naturally wish to have before you permit me to have the satisfaction of
assuring you that my patient and i may add my dearest friend
philip flint is in a degree recovered from the illness brought on by
the first agitation of his spirits his amiable wife is well and as yet
a stranger to the shocking tale i will now begin my melancholy task

the arrival of a large vessel in this port from new york and commanded
by a captain nelson may be assigned as one of those cases which have
produced the event before me in consequence of mr flamalls having a
concern in the cargo he was induced to quit his retirement and to come
to the creek plantation near this place to this circumstance i was a
stranger however having as mr flints friend dropped a man
generally condemned for his inflexibility and at present forgotten by
that society which for some time he had so carefully and gloomily
avoided

i happened to be at the general rendezvous a coffeehouse here when a
merchant of the name of gilpin an intimate friend of mine entered
with captain nelson the newly arrived stranger i was presented to him
by my friend and in a way which the captain and myself both appeared
to understand i found that mr gilpin had long known this gentleman
and in a few minutes i thought i had long known him myself from the
frankness of his manner we were settling our plan for dining together
when one of the waiters told mr nelson that mr flamall was on
horseback at the door and wished to speak to him for a minute the
captain instantly obeyed the summons and in a few minutes he returned
to the room and i saw flamall pass the window i remarked to some one
near me that he looked ill and dejected the captain was now disturbed
by a more serious business some one in the passage called loudly for
assistance and the captain was told that his steward was in the
agonies of death in the corridor we flew to the spot and as a
medical man it became my duty to succour the sick one he had been
suddenly surprised by the bursting of a large blood vessel and the
case was critical and justly alarming i was however struck by the
uncommon interest which the captain appeared to take in the poor mans
preservation every accommodation the house could afford was speedily
procured and i saw my patient in a spacious bedroom with a negro woman
for his attendant whom i knew was a good nurse some abatement of the
hmorrhage having succeeded to bleeding in the arm and other remedies
i left him to his repose and joined my friends at mr gilpins whose
house was not remote from my patient captain nelson listened to my
account of him with the utmost anxiety i would give half i am worth
said he grasping my hand to save this man this complaint came on in
a moment they tell me he was apparently well when i passed him and
that was not five minutes before you saw him those near him say it was
a fit for they heard him groan and he rose from his seat as if to
seek air when he fell back and the blood gushed from his mouth i saw
in this account his hopes of the mans recovery which i could not
encourage and wished not to depress

after dinner he attended me to visit him i have known this man many
years said he i have no doubt of his having been unfortunate his
education and manners speak the gentleman his conduct and industry the
honest man his reserve and dejection have imposed on me a respect for
his misfortunes and to this hour i only know that his name is charles
and that he is a very extraordinary man for his fidelity to me has
not lessened his influence with my people who all love him as their
best friend tomorrow morning i shall bring his boy on shore to be
with him then he has a son observed i one of his adoption
answered he and his motives for so doing will give you his character
i had lost sight of him for some years having left him in london in
his passage from thence to new york where as it appears he was as
poor as when i first saw him he was a common seaman one of the crew a
native of new york fell sick and died on the passage recommending to
charles his aged mother and his child this boy he promised to take
care of them and he kept his word for taking up his abode in the old
womans miserable hovel he supported the family by his labour in this
situation i again met him the death of the woman and my offer to take
the boy with him induced him to accept the post of ship steward on
board my ship where he has been several years you will judge of him as
a schoolmaster when you see george poor lad continued the captain
he will break his heart but i will be his friend

i returned to my patient but did not allow him to speak he was told
that his george would be with him in the morning and his hand only was
offered to the captain

on entering the room the following day i found george at his post the
patient was raised by his pillows and one of the finest youths my eyes
ever beheld filled the space they had left he was bending over the
sick man in an attitude convenient for his head to rest on the lads
shoulder who was as i judged between fifteen and sixteen and in the
full vigour of youth he raised his penetrating large black eyes to my
face whilst i made my enquiries of the woman relative to the condition
of his father her replies were not unfavourable and never shall i
forget the look of gratitude i then received but overcome by his
sensibility he wept most bitterly and hid his face captain nelson
entered at this moment why how is this my boy cried he
endeavouring to hide his feelings did you not promise to have a good
heart the doctor will soon set us all to rights again so have
courage the doctor my dear sir was not so sanguine but
recommending silence and repose took his leave george assuring me that
he would watch his fathers eyes and those would tell him what he
wanted in the evening i was with him again all was in order and a
silence like death prevailed in the room george was reading a french
telemachus the patient was dosing and the negro woman was dismissed
for some hours of needful rest the next day i had hopes that my
patient had a chance but the following morning i found to my surprise
only the nurse with him on enquiry i learned from her that his father
had sent him with a letter to the creek plantation why did you not
find a porter asked i because he said answered she in a low
whisper he could not die contented unless he knew that it was
delivered to mr flamall though by no means pleased with this exertion
of writing i said but little to the sick man contenting myself with
his answer i shall write no more i prolonged my stay partly to
supply nurses absence whom i sent for something needful and partly to
gratify my curiosity the sick mans person was calculated to excite it
his physiognomy was noble his features regular dark blue eyes which
though sunk and dimmed by his condition were expressive of manly
fortitude his hair was of a light chestnut colour but in places
striped with the signs of age for it was even changed to nearly white
he was extremely fair and the paleness of death was relieved by a
lingering colour in his lips observing the beauty of his teeth i asked
him his age he replied that he believed he was turned of fifty he was
neatly dressed in a blue and white cotton waistcoat and trowsers and
reclined on the outside of the matrass a statuary would not have wished
for a more perfect model of the human form he was in height i should
think within six feet i observed to him that his chest was not made
to oppress his lungs and that i flattered myself the malady which had
so suddenly overtaken him might have for its course a less dangerous
source he smiled and said he had never had any tendency to
consumptive symptoms nor did he ever attribute his want of health to a
weak constitution at this instant george entered covered with dust
and exhausted by heat and fatigue he approached the bed and said i
have seen mr flamall and given your letter into his own hand it is
well replied my patient with an emotion that alarmed me for i was
still feeling the pulse and those would have betrayed it without the
suffusion which passed his cheek i turned towards george and after
lecturing him with kindness for his imprudent speed i insisted on his
leaving the room and laying down for some hours a sign from his
father which he understood made him docile and he retired soon after
i left the sick room cautioning the nurse neither to admit mr flamall
nor any message from him or others to reach her charge and taking some
sherbet in my hand i sought georges little room he had obeyed me and
had taken off his clothes i told him the consequences which would
result from any exertion or surprise to his father warning him to be on
the watch he said he did not believe his father expected either a
visit or an answer from the gentleman in question he had told him not
to wait for any orders and had appeared only anxious that his own
letter should reach him safely

i proceeded to the coffeehouse where as i expected i met captain
nelson i gave him this detail and he thought no more of it i believe
for he was surrounded by busy faces and he told me that he should be
with charles soon and would meet me at mr gilpins before sunset

i dined with my friend and we were quietly conversing when captain
nelson bursting into the room said with agony it is all over with
him nothing can now save him i waited not for more intelligence but
seizing my hat hastily made my way to the sick man nelson following
me it was indeed all over with him all our care and attention
availed nothing for in a few hours he died poor nelson during this
scene of painful suspense lamented in terms of the bitterest grief
that he had caused the relapse he said that he had found him quiet and
apparently easy the nurse said george was sound asleep and mentioned
your orders added the captain i asked charles what were his
connexions with mr flamall he calmly replied that he had known him
in his youth and was that all asked i come be open with me you
have had george in your head i dare say and fancying to make a friend
for the poor lad but give yourself no concern about him let the worst
come to the worst he will never want a father whilst i have a guinea
so try and be a man again and the brother of one who loves you as a
brother he grasped my hand with convulsive strength my god said he
aloud i thank thee and die satisfied that thou art a god merciful
and gracious the blood again gushed from his mouth and i flew to
gilpins

i will pass over the sorrow of his poor george in order to hasten to
the next still more serious and shocking event mr sinclair the
brother of my patient mrs flint brought me a summons to upland the
residence of the family prepared to expect hourly the ladys want of my
assistance i accompanied her brother home but found mrs flint though
in her own apartment with her female friends perfectly contented with
my being within the house the interval was devoted to my friend
philips amusement whose anxiety for the safety of his wife was
apparent we were rallying him on this subject and drinking to the
health of his expected blessing when mr sinclair was called from the
table i will pass over the detail juba an old and freed slave of the
late mr cowleys but who has from his masters death remained in his
post of superintendent at the creek house was the bearer of the
intelligence which follows and which you will conceive produced the
most dreadful sensations of horror and surprise mr flamall was dead
and by his own hand sinclair and myself lost no time in returning
with juba leaving mr flint to the care of mr lindsey and mr
montrose his friends and inmates

on the road juba gave us the following particulars on the preceding
morning he it was who saw george who enquired of him for mr flamall
saying he had a letter to deliver to him which he was ordered to give
to no other person i asked the lad from whom he had received his
commission continued the faithful juba and he replied from captain
nelsons steward knowing that we had many bales in his ship i
immediately concluded that the letter referred to business relative to
these goods and i was on the point of telling the young man that i
would be answerable for the safety of the letter but at that moment
mr flamall appeared and took it himself i shall be at kingston to
day said he holding the letter carelessly in his hand and shall speak
to your captain the lad bowed and was retreating when mr flamall
asked him to rest and take some refreshment he declined the offer
replying that his father would want him i entered the house and he
departed mr flamall was not long i believe before he went to his
apartment he saw no one for some hours at length he rang his bell and
ordered his horse to be prepared we have lately observed him as a man
struggling with something wrong in his mind he has been very odd at
times and his groom said he was in one of his silent fits and chose
to go by himself he did not return home till a late hour in the
evening the horse appeared heated and fatigued he went to his bed
room saying that he wanted nothing then and should ring in the
morning when he did hour succeeded hour we heard him pacing in the
library and we began to fear that all was not right with him his
servant was curious as well as uneasy he stopped me on the staircase
to tell me that he had peeped through the key hole that his master was
in his wrapping gown and night cap and was writing and with a
countenance that made him tremble another servant was going to make his
observations by the same means continued poor juba when the report
of a pistol checked him and appalled us all we burst into the room it
was too late you will see such a corpse i lost not however my
presence of mind one look at the shattered mangled head of the poor
wretch was enough for me but whilst others were gazing on the scene of
horror i secured the written papers on his desk which i will now give
you

juba drew the rumpled sheets of paper from his bosom and presented them
to mr sinclair it is needless for me to add that the horrid
explosion had done its work the aim was sure

herewith you have the copies of the two letters above mentioned mr
sinclair recommends caution to you in respect to their mysterious
contents

i shall have perhaps time to add something more to this letter but lest
i be mistaken receive sir the unfeigned regard and sympathy of your
very humble servant

                                                           thomas paget


                              letter lxvi

                      enclosed in mr pagets

                           to mr flamall

shouldest thou start flamall at the sight of these well known
characters for my hand like my heart has but one for my purposes
should thy knees tremble and the blood recede in terror from thy cheek
bless heaven hail these indications of its mercy thou hast not yet
outlived humanity thou art not yet abandoned to everlasting
destruction be it so oh god infinite in goodness almighty in power

were i certain flamall that with the form of man there were yet one
single spark left unextinguished of the spirit of a man i would
invite thee to my dying couch for it is near thee i would bid thee
compare it with thy nightly bed of prosperous villany and here settle
those accounts of the guardianship and gains though for years in
bondage i have been free from guilt no parent will demand from me a
ruined oppressed son no confederate in vice and cruelty and treachery
will point to me as the betrayer of his soul but thou wilt recall to
memory the issue of thy crimes and the names of thy agents in mischief

i die in peace my wife knows my innocence and my wrongs if it be
needful for thy repentance apply to her and with the tale of thy
brotherly care of an innocent and virtuous orphansister thou mayest
have the relation of the woes thou hast inflicted on thy ward charles

detain not the messenger i wait his return to breathe my last sigh on
his faithful bosom thou hast been defeated flamall the tear of
affection will fall on my remains and i shall be remembered as one who
has not lived to be the fell destroyer of my fellowman nor as one
abandoned by his maker


                             letter lxvii
                from mr flamall to mr philip flint

                      enclosed in mr pagets

horror unutterable horror anguish despair twist not thus my brain
he is dead and died with his hopes expecting to be welcomed in a new
existence by assembled angels hailed by spirits like his own and
received by a god of mercy who will recompense his long sufferings and
faithdelusions all the tales of the nursery made up for children i
reject them when these atoms which compose this palpitating frame are
disunited i shall be at peace for i shall be nothing but wherefore
do i pause what is to me the world to which i now cleave why does my
heart turn to thee philip i know thou also abhorrest me yet i would
not have thee curse me for of all men i have a claim to thy pity i
love thee still i would bless thee but i dare not for if there be a
god whose awful indignation takes cognizance of sin my blessing would
be converted into a malediction on thy head blot me from thy memory
acknowledge not the name of flamall nor permit thy children to know
that i was once thy guide thy friendnaydistraction why do i
hesitate

mr paget in continuation

it is needless to make any comments on the foregoing letters it is but
too apparent that flamall was the aggressor beyond this all is
conjecture we have on our part acted with caution captain nelson has
been questioned closely as to his knowledge of the person supposed to
have been the cause of the dreadful end of mr flamall he repeated on
oath his evidence in favour of this unknown and adhered to the account
he had before given me of his acquaintance with him adding that he had
not a doubt of his having been an injured man his sorrow for his loss
was not concealed for he even shed tears and with an oath affirmed
that not only himself but every man in his ship had lost a brother poor
george was with him and looked the picture of despair he was examined
also he had never heard his father and protector name mr flamall until
the morning he gave him the letter not a single paper was found in his
chest except a note in which he gives with his blessing his little
property of clothes linen and a few books to this boy thus has every
enquiry terminated i cannot help believing that you will be gratified
by knowing that captain nelson means to protect the lad in question

mr flamall has been careful to leave no traces behind him that may
help to elucidate this mystery or throw a light on any other of his
private concerns not a paper nor a letter escaped his vigilant
cautions juba tells us that from the time his nephews marriage was
announced he has suspected his mind to have been deranged at times and
that he was continually reading and burning letters and papers when in
his room one striking proof of his former connexion with the
unfortunate stranger charles is much talked of he called at the house
where he lodged and died and to the enquiries he made concerning the
sick man one of the servants answered that he was dead he said he
wished to see him having known him in his youth the negro woman
attended him to the deceased mans room he looked attentively at the
corpse appeared agitated and sighing said his troubles are over
but such was the impression the object before him had produced that he
left the house and forgot his horse which he had tied to the door he
had passed a waiter perceiving it followed him with the animal he
mounting and without speaking put him on his full speed

                             letter lxviii
                 from capt sinclair to capt flint

 my dear sir      jamaica

our worthy and zealous friend mr paget having spared me the painful
detail of events which of late have rendered this abode of peace one
of sorrow and consternation i will employ my pen on subjects of better
and renewed hopes in the first place lady maclairn will be soothed by
hearing that philip is the father of a fine healthy boy and that the
mother is doing well and already the nurse she has been cautiously
told of mr flamalls death and thus the suspense and alarm avoided
that would have been occasioned by her seeing her husbands dejection
which was but too apparent in spite of his endeavours we must give him
credit for more sensibility on this melancholy occasion than we feel
ourselves to say the truth the termination of a life passed without
honour or satisfaction is in my opinion little entitled to the tear
of affection although the means which flamall employed for the
purpose are appalling to nature and to the christian it is a happy
circumstance for my brother that he has uniformly conducted himself in
respect to his uncle so as to have secured his own self acquittal
this with the prospect of happiness before his eyes will in time
restore him we shall however wait with anxiety for news from
farefield had not his wifes critical situation checked his solicitude
for his mother i believe we could not have prevented his undertaking
the voyage to england for the purpose of supporting her in the trial
which nearly overset himself

i beg you to be particular in your account of lady maclairns health as
also miss flints

let miss cowley be assured that her concerns will suffer nothing from
the loss of her agent we have been fortunate in having with us a mr
montrose this gentleman is the early friend of philip and margaret
and is brother to mrs lindsey my sisters first nurse and constant
companion at present

montrose makes a better consoler than myself i therefore yield up to
him this office as being his by profession and no man can better know
and perform his duty i have not however been idle the attested
papers you will receive with this will inform you that all has been
done that could be done flamalls late gloom and the evidence of the
servants induced the coroners inquest to give in a verdict of lunacy
we have discovered no letters nor papers of consequence to his private
concerns and one letter excepted of a recent date from his banker
which mentions his having received the half years interest of five
thousand pounds bank stock this of course devolves to his sister i
cannot conclude this letter without telling you that i believe from
the order in which all flamalls accounts were that he has for
sometime been meditating how to escape from a world in which he knew
he was regarded with contempt you may think me too harsh be it so but
believe me sincere and honest and

                                               yours to command
                                                       francis sinclair


                              letter lxix
                 from dr douglass to mr hardcastle

                                                   farefield dec 

i conjure you my dear sir to rely on my assurances miss cowley is
entirely out of danger we have a decided intermission and are hourly
gaining on the enemy but i will not disguise my fears for the
consequences which will probably result from you and miss hardcastles
visit here at this time the truth is that as terror and exertions
beyond miss cowleys strength produced the fever it is my opinion
that joy and a new demand on her feelings will produce a return of
it calmness and repose are necessary to give efficacy to the medicines
which have hitherto been useful and i entreat of you to postpone your
journey till my patient is more able to welcome you

to say what this young creatures fortitude has been is beyond my
abilities i only know that i shall in future blush when i hear
strength of mind called a masculine endowment

you will easily imagine how little prepared she was after the
attention and exertions she had shown to lady maclairn to sustain the
sudden terror which miss flints death produced every precaution had
been used to prevent the intelligence of mr flamalls death from
reaching the dying woman she was so weak as to bear with apathy her
sisters absence from the room indeed she noticed little those who
were about her being for the most part in a lethargic stupor and
gradually sinking in the neighbourhood it was however no secret that
mr flamall had died suddenly warner miss flints woman had in the
morning left her post to a chamber maid in order to get some repose
this girls mother had been frequently employed in the sick room and
she on calling to see her daughter was directed where to find her
miss flint was heavily dozing and the women though with precaution
as they say talked of poor lady maclairns illness and the
melancholy news from jamaica the visitor had heard the report which
has circulated here and which a london newspaper has communicated to
the public namely that mr flamall was assassinated by a negro whom
he had too severely treated i suspect the precaution of whispering
this tale was forgotten in the eagerness of curiosity and the love of
the marvellous suddenly they were alarmed by a faint scream from the
sick woman who with convulsive groans and agitations said dead
murdered lost for ever lost flamall screams followed this
apostrophe and the terrified girl ran to miss cowleys room she was
unfortunately sleeping on the sopha after having passed the greater
part of the night by lady maclairns bed side she rose with firmness
to perform the duty to which she was summoned not permitting mrs allen
to be informed of what was passing because she was with lady maclairn
i found her calm and collected sitting by the dying miss flint whose
senses were lost before she ceased to breathe let me finish this
melancholy detail by saying that i did not quit miss cowleys bed side
for the space of six and thirty hours heaven was merciful and she will
be restored to health but we must have no beloved friends to greet at
present

i quit you to obey the summons of my precious patient she insists
upon signing this bulletin she will soon be well for she is growing
saucy and this morning at four oclock when i carried her the
prescribed potion she told me that in my night cap and gown i was the
very image of blue beard and still more savage than he for that his
scymitar was nothing in comparison with my glass of poison judge with
what contentment of mind i now sign the name of your sincere

                                                     archibald douglass

ps indeed my dear lucy i am getting well they tell me the wind is
still against the lisbon packets sailing how fortunate i am there
the whole junto are rising and the inkstand has vanished yours your
own r cowley is indeed only too weak to mutiny against this
authority


                              letter lxx
                 from miss cowley to miss hardcastle

it is with gratitude to heaven that i find my dear friends at heathcot
are relieved from their too tender anxieties and apprehensions on my
account yet wherefore do i say too tender i recall the words my
lucy which my heart does not sanction and i will not assume a virtue i
have not i give you joy that death has spared to you your rachel
cowley i rejoice in your love and i participate in your present
feelings your goodness to horace has contributed towards my
restoration i should have died had you mentioned your terrors to him

i have written to him the state of affairs here he will be satisfied
that the recent events in which i have been engaged occasioned the
brevity of my letter

mrs heartley sends her love to you with the enclosed she insists that
you will be better pleased with it than with my labours they have
amongst them annihilated the self will of your

                                                          rachel cowley


                              letter lxxi
                   from mr serge to mrs heartley

                     enclosed in the preceding

 madam      putney

i make no doubt but that you have heard mr maclairn mention his friend
jeremiah serge and that you are convinced i mean to deserve my title
i shall therefore enter into the business before us at once herewith
you will receive the deeds which secure to your daughter and her
children the estate called the wenland farm now occupied by malcolm
maclairn the day she becomes that gentlemans wife he is her tenant
and his childrens steward counsellor steadman has managed this affair
for me to my entire satisfaction and i trust it will not be less so to
my young friend

i have for the first time during many long weeks felt that the
almighty has yet the means in his hands with which to heal my wounds i
never mrs heartley had a son i have not like sir murdoch had a son
like his malcolm to follow me in my feeble steps with duty and
affection nor try to perpetuate my name and his own virtues to
children unborn but i had a child who was whilst she lived the joy
and the prop of my life but you know what i have had to suffer i am
forgetting the object of this letter

from the first hour i knew mr malcolm maclairn i took a liking to him
this goodwill was in part owing to the favourable character i had of
him from my excellent friend counsellor steadman some particulars i
learned from this gentleman led me to think that it was in my power to
serve this worthy young man and with this intention and other
thoughts in my mind i paid my visit to farefield hall i was in part
disappointed in my scheme but i saw the young man was all and
more than i expected and i gave him my heart though i could not
give him my daughters hand i thought i had explained myself to his
good father in regard to my views in assisting the son but i
perceived that sir murdoch had a little of the infirmity which is
common to men of high birth so i consulted the counsellor and did what
i could without offending the baronets high spirit

believing that you are a very judicious lady i request from you the
favour in case you should see the good baronets scruples to say what
in truth you may affirm that you perceive nothing in my conduct that
ought either to offend or surprise him

some men with less wealth than i possess keep fine houses fine
madams and fine horses buy fine pictures and plant fine gardens now
mrs heartley i have no taste nor pleasure in these things seeing i
was not brought up to like or understand them but this is no reason
why my money should be useless to me and if i can purchase by my
superfluity the happiness of having such a friend as malcolm maclairn
i should be a fool not to have done what i have done so heartily
wishing the young couple happy and recommending to your fair daughter
to marry her tenant directly

                                                 i remain your sincere
                                                         jeremiah serge


                             letter lxxii
                 from miss cowley to miss hardcastle

                                                           january 

my patience is recompensed i may write half an hour seeing that
scribbling is the aliment some girls live upon this is my kind doctor
lucy and if you had seen how grateful i was for this indulgence you
would be of mrs heartleys opinion who has pronounced my fever good
for something for that it has saved lady maclairns life and as you
may perceive has taught me to submit blessed be god for the renewal of
that life which is so dear to my friends and which i may if it be not
my fault still render a blessing to them and myself

we are once more in sight of the harbour of peace not indeed of that
peace which this world can neither give nor take away but of that
season of tranquillity which in mercy is allotted to man in order
as it should seem to give us time to refit our feeble bark and to
rectify the chart to which we have hitherto trusted to recover by
repose strength and vigour for the storms and perils we may yet have to
encounter in our passage to eternity and to leave behind us traces of
that providential power which hath piloted us home

you will like to have the particulars of miss flints will it will
satisfy you as it has done me that a deathbed repentance is much
better than none she specifies that in consideration of her brother
olivers donation to philip flint it appears to be an incumbent duty on
her part to provide for those of her family who have been too long
neglected and to the last moment of her mortal life will she bless
philip flint for having seconded her in this act of justice by his
advice and concurrence

the farefield estate with the moveables besides a considerable sum in
money which will devolve on him as residuary legatee are left to
captain flint for his life at his decease they go to philip flint to
whom she has only bequeathed five thousand pounds as a token of her
love to her niece mary the same sum payable when she is of age and
five more at her uncles decease to malcolm maclairn two thousand
pounds as a mark of her esteem for him and gratitude to his
mother by the way poor malcolm was nearly overpowered by this mark
for he had not mourned as one who needed comfort and i suspect that his
conscience was not quite prepared for the legacy

to the poor of the parish she has left a liberal peace offering to her
servants she has been generous and just to warner her woman she
leaves a thousand pounds

flamalls execrable name does not appear in any paper that is left and
yet the contents of the cabinet left to lady maclairns inspection
clearly prove that miss flint had long been engaged by the thoughts of
death not a friend has been overlooked but flamall and it is evident
to me that she ceased to regard him even in that point of view from
the time he declared his marriage i suspect she was informed of his
baseness in that business all her little donations were marked and
ticketed by her own hand to sir murdoch she leaves a very fine seal
its antiquity as well as beauty make it valuable to mrs allen a gold
snuff box containing an hundred pound bank note for mourning for
miss cowley a diamond ring to each of douglasss boys a hundred guineas
for books and three hundred pounds in notes for their worthy father a
small box directed to my niece mary howard as a token of my too late
repentance and unfeigned love the captain who was present when her
ladyship performed this painful office was so much affected by the
sight of this box that he burst into tears and with extreme
agitation tore off the address and put it in his bosom philip flint
had not been overlooked in this partition of kindness her picture in
miniature taken at the time he was born with a rich string of pearls
that had been her mothers were marked for him and his wife we have
since examined marys gift some fine lace and a few family jewels are
the principal things when you have cautiously informed her that from
her aunts hand she has restored to her what she will judge to be
invaluable namely her fathers and mothers pictures so long lost
so deeply regretted but i am called to order and you will be contented
with this four days labour of your poor shackled rachel cowley who is
bound though in silken fetters you know that the heartleys are here i
gain nothing by that for they are as bad as any of my arguseyed nurses

p s my dear miss hardcastle we have now only to fear that our patient
should be too soon well she has no fever but that which arises from
her exertions she cannot vegetate to use her own word and she
thinks her body is strong because her mind is never idle it is in vain
that we oppose her she will write and then who can wonder that she
does not sleep use your influence and give us time to recruit her
strength

                                                        yours
                                                            a heartley

mrs allen is in good spirits she has left me nothing to say in regard
to doctor douglass but i verily believe his care saved the life of
our precious friend she was indeed for some hours so ill as to leave
little for hope i leave alice to express to my dear mary all that my
full heart feels on her account




                               chap xii


                             letter lxxiii
                 from miss cowley to miss hardcastle

                                                           january 

although in the calculation of months and weeks i have contrived to
beguile the lagging hours which are still between me and my promised
bliss i have not yet been able to find an expedient for the day
without scribbling to you it seems to be the aliment necessary for my
existence and notwithstanding i could match an hungry school boy in my
appetite for my pudding i could sooner console myself for the absence
of my dinner than of the use of my right hand as the agent of my
fondest sweetest employment i have written a volume to horace and he
will know as much of the occurrences at farefield as will content him
he will know that i am in health and in hope say not a word of my
having been so ill the old bard says men are deceivers ever a woman
therefore may for once deceive when in that deceit she spares to a
beloved object the useless anxiety arising from past danger and past
pains

yesterday our busyheads went to wenland place in order to give their
opinion of certain alterations and improvements projected by the new
tenant malcolm i was ordered to stay at home by my despotical doctor
and lady maclairn promised to take good care of me

they departed after breakfast meaning to dine at mr wilsons and left
us to a danger as bad as cold rooms i soon found it impossible to
evade the topic i so much dreaded for her she at once led to the
subject by saying that she had still secrets to communicate to her only
comforter but that she feared my sensibility i desired her to proceed
some time before my sisters death continued she i received this
sealed parcel from her hands it is as you see addressed to myself i
hesitated when she offered it to my acceptance she observed my
reluctance make yourself perfectly easy said miss flint it
contains nothing but papers essentially necessary for your future
security i cannot die without telling you that they are necessary
you do not know your brother harriet so well as i do and i must tell
you what steps i have taken to secure you from his future tyranical
power i shall die however without bitterness of spirit i once loved
flamall i do not accuse him here nor will i accuse him hereafter
for my own envy my own implacable spirit my own stubborn and hard
heart prepared the way for the influence of his inordinate purposes and
more deliberate mischiefs as a father he has been equally base and
cruel philip has informed me of the measures he pursued in order to
gratify his ambition in regard to his sons marriage with miss cowley
let it suffice that they were such as did not surprise me i
immediately wrote to mr flamall you will find a copy of my letter
amongst those papers he knows that i have by a full and ample
confession of my crimes so implicated them with those which he has
committed as must ruin him in this world if discovered and as
inevitably destroy his hopes of a better if he do not repent should he
ever dare to disturb the comforts of my son by a declaration of his
real affinity to him should he ever dare farther to invade on your
peace he knows what must be the consequence actions which will be
recognisable in a court of justice will determine his fate and crush
with ignominy his worthy and unoffending child obdurate as he is in
sin nature is not extinguished in his bosom he loves his son and i
am certain would sooner die himself than see him disgraced in the
world time may soften to him his present disappointment i have urged
to philip every possible measure in order to effect a reconciliation
between him and his uncle flamall he may if he be wise live on good
terms with his son and if he be not lost to conscience he may find
employment for his remaining term of grace you weep my dear
harriet continued my poor lucretia i cannot how many bitter tears of
yours will swell my account for i was born for your sorrow and the
ruin of the innocent can you give comfort to the broken and contrite of
heart can you say you forgive me as freely answered i eagerly as
i hope for mercy and pardon i have also sinned i have also erred
yes replied she with quickness but the snare was laid for you and
you only stumbled i boldly invited the danger and made an
acquaintance with guilt and perfidy see to what purpose to languish
with a mothers yearnings to behold and bless that child who would
shrink from me as a monster did he know me to dread the future and to
mourn too late the wretchedness annexed to a life of guilt promise
me added she to be still my philips mother let me die in the hope
that you will never forego the title never answered i sensible
only to her condition never whilst it depends on me to preserve it
he is mine in affection and nothing can cancel his rights to my love
may heaven reward you exclaimed she in an agony may that childs
children bless and revere youmy poor boy will not be surprised at the
tenor of my last will continued she thoughtfully he is rich and i
have explained my intentions in regard to my brother and mary it
required very few arguments to prove that they had not been justly
treated but let me not think of their wrongs i wrote him word that it
was essentially necessary to my peace to consider them his last letter
was a cordial to my sinking soul he urges me even to omit his name if
it interfered with my kind purposes that he possessed more than he
wanted of the goods of fortune judge adds he when i tell you that my
brother has frequently realized fourteen thousand pounds annually from
his estates judge whether my dear i may say maternal friend and
sister needs bequeath me more than her blessing and her love i
wear at my heart this precious letter added she taking it from her
bosom but you must take it with the papers his picture may yet
remain i mean it should moulder into dust with meshe pausedi
think pursued she as though collecting herself that i may hope to
stand acquitted before my maker for the last and only compensation i can
make to some whom i have injured perhaps strict justice would exact
more sacrifices but i am a mother harriet the guilty mother of an
innocent child now a worthy member of society something is surely due
to him and thy merciful maker will not weigh this consideration in the
balance of offended justice such has been my state of mind for some
time past that had it not been for philip i would have fearlessly met
every stigma with which this world could have branded me for the hopes
of meeting with a reconciled god it becomes not me to say that i
think in this instance of my conduct i have acted right but
conscience has at least been my guide i have done for the best will
not that prudence which will protect the honour of your family and the
happiness of mine sanction your secresy in regard to the birth of thy
poor she could not go on again i soothed her to composure i
solemnly repeated my promise my dear miss cowley that i would preserve
our secret from every danger of a disclosure this engagement now
distresses me continued lady maclairn i fear i have been wrong but
what could i do in a moment of such difficulty i was unequal to the
trial i could not see her die miserable

i placed before lady maclairn the wonderful interference of providence
which had removed the guilty to secure the innocent i urged to her the
purity of her intentions and the humanity which pointed out to her the
line of conduct she had pursued and had engaged to pursue repose on
your merciful maker added i for an acquittal where you mean to do
for the best patiently wait the end when this darkness shall be
removed and you will i trust find that having lived to promote the
happiness of others to have contributed to the comfort and security of
your family has not been to live in vain be assured my dear friend
that your sufferings will have their place with a being who knoweth
what is in man and with a father who loveth his children you may
reasonably hope for acceptance and favour you are my comforter
replied she meekly raising her eyes to heaven i have not outlived
this first of all human hopes my weakness not my will has betrayed me
from the paths of rectitude but it is difficult for me to conceal my
feelings i dare not even break the seal which confines my knowledge to
what i already know of the wretched life and conduct of my brother i
sometimes think i shall lose my senses in reflecting on his end and
the enormities of his conduct oh it is dreadful miss cowley to
follow him to that tribunal before which he must appearleave me for a
while added she sobbing leave me to my god to my almighty
supporteri obeyed too much affected to resist i took the papers
with me she has acted prudently in not reading them she begs they may
be forwarded to you and that the whole transaction may remain in your
hands you are allowed to read them what will you say to the letter
marked no  the one she burned was the answer to it but i dare not
pursue this horrid subject my eyes would betray me and the doctor
would be angry for he has made me promise not to harrass my spirits
and to check my friends sorrows i am going to her and we will be
wise the return of the vagrants renders this necessary

                                                  yours
                                                          rachel cowley

p s sedley will give you this


                             letter lxxiv
                 from miss cowley to miss hardcastle

again i am permitted to take a better cordial than bark mrs heartley
has fully explained to us the mystery relative to the portraits in miss
flints possession it appears that mrs howard apprehending that they
would be more pernicious to her brother than consolatory requested
mrs heartley to secrete them from his search she obeyed her dying
friend but added mrs heartley my feelings at this juncture were
nearly as little under the control of my reason as poor percivals i
wrote a letter to miss flint which was dictated by my sorrow and the
romantic hope of touching her heart in favour of a child whom she had
contributed to render an orphan and a beggar i enclosed these
powerful pleaders continued mrs heartley taking up the miniatures
and surveying them with emotion and my language was not less forcible
malcolm was employed to place my packet in her hands he effected his
purpose for she found it on her dressing table the next morning he was
questioned and he frankly owned that he had at my request placed the
parcel where she had found it you have been faithful sir in the
performance of your commission said miss flint trembling and pale with
fury be so in delivering my message to your mrs heartley tell her
that her insolent and officious interference has failed and that whilst
miss flints family have no better advocates than a kept mistress she
wants no apology for renouncing it malcolm bluntly told her that she
must employ some one to deliver such a message who had never heard of
mrs heartley for himself he begged leave to decline insulting his
best friend i heard no more from miss flint and i concluded that she
had destroyed the portraits in a similar manner as she had that of her
mother frustrated in my project i was forced to conceal this
occurrence and the pictures were supposed to be irrecoverably and
unaccountably lost

although my conscience reproached me frequently when hearing the captain
bewail this loss it never did so as to the motive from which i had
acted but it is to be feared that my zeal in the cause of the injured
disqualified me for making a convert to justice and humanity it is most
probable that i irritated where i wished to heal and it is certain
that i was from that time the object of miss flints implacable
resentment poor woman continued mrs heartley with compassion she
was then under the miserable yoke of those passions which although they
govern cannot blind us neither her spirit of resentment nor any
entrenchment from her prosperous fortune could shield her from the
voice within her bosom it spoke my language with tenfold energy and
she hated me because she knew i was in unison with her conscience she
shunned me as she would have shunned that had she been able is it
not unaccountable added mrs heartley addressing me that any
rational being should fear to encounter the eyes of a fellow creature
under the circumstances of guilt nay even of folly without
considering the power of conscience from whose suggestions this very
dread arises that miss flint was sensible of its power is certain nor
do i believe with some that it is possible for us to outlive its
authority when i hear of such who are said to be hardened by sin and
become callous by guilt i no more believe it than i do those tales i
hear of the elixir for perpetuating our existence here for ever i am
convinced that god will not be mocked by the creatures of his power and
i have only to follow the bold and impious offender of his laws to his
hours of privacy to learn that he cannot evade that beings presence
whose commands he insults i was more disposed to shorten this
conversation than to dispute the truths it contained lady maclairns
conscience wants no stimulants douglass entered and we became
cheerful you love the doctor you say prithee who does not but no one
shall love him so well as horace you have heard of his gallantry three
or four nights he past in my antichamber

                                                          rachel cowley


                              letter lxxv
                 from miss cowley to miss hardcastle

i am my dear friend so powerfully impressed by the perusal of miss
flints confession as her legacy to lady maclairn may with truth be
called that i cannot divert my mind from the subject what a scene of
iniquity have i sent you and how rejoiced am i that i prevailed on
lady maclairn not to tear open those wounds afresh by reading a detailed
account of actions and artifices which her brother employed to defraud
mr flints children of their rights surely my lucy the death of
flamall was a consummation devoutly to be wished to be removed from
the indignation of the injured to be spared from the abhorrence of the
virtuous to be saved from the constant dread of living an object
amenable to the most vigorous laws of his country to be freed from the
horrors of his dying bed but how momentary is this delusion of feeling
my reason and my faith point out this disembodied spirit in its next
state of existence with trembling awe i follow it to the tribunal of an
allwise omnipotent and pure judge there do i contemplate this
forlorn and sullied soul as rushing uncalled into the presence of that
being whose merciful purposes he has counteracted and whose laws he
has insulted nature stands appalled at the magnitude of offences like
these and humanity must deplore the sinner thus cut off in the midst of
his sins

i cannot however help being of opinion that useful as the contemplation
of a flamalls life may be to beings who fearlessly follow the impulse
of every disorderly passion we my beloved lucy shall not be unwise
to direct our thoughts from such shocking depravity of creatures like
ourselves i wish so to do and yet not lose the lesson of wisdom as
applicable to myself in what i would ask you consisted the difference
between miss flint and rachel cowley at two years of age the general
lineaments of our minds have a near affinity what has produced the
moral differences which from that period have discriminated us
education and the habits resulting from our respective situations in
the one instance the soil was left uncultured in the other it was
judiciously cultivated lucretia had been overlooked by her mother in
the early period of her life indolence and indulgence were this
mothers faults she found in cultivating the docile and mild percival
a gratification of her own taste and an object of amusement as well as
for exclusive tenderness this mother wanted firmness and the vigilance
necessary for her duty when passion had taken its root this unhappy
creature was consigned over to the care and tuition of a schoolmistress
i mean not to be illiberal for i believe many women in that class of
life are not only accomplished women but conscientiously disposed to be
useful to their pupils but i cannot think that in a large school
either the temper or peculiar moral defects of a girl are likely to
meet with that nice and accurate observation which are necessary for
their correction i will however admit that in this seminary miss flint
acquired the outward habits of decorum and that knowledge which with
experience and a different temper might have conducted her as it does
multitudes of our sex in the common routine of private and domestic
life she then returned to her parents slenderly furnished by the gifts
of nature with a spirit unsubdued and a mind without any fixed
principle of action beyond a confidence in herself she was next a
candidate for favour in the world and she proudly conceived that no one
would dare refuse it but she found a rival even in the cradle and
under the parental roof is it to be expected that from such a
disposition and under such circumstances envy and malice could be long
a stranger to her the mother perceived their baneful influence and she
opposed to their growth nothing but remedies which relieved herself
from trouble and vexation she flattered instead of reproving and
gave to her daughter an authority which she knew she would abuse
uncontrouled and domineering over those about her irritated by the
neglect of those whom she could not subjugate to her imperious will she
became soured disappointed and vindictive and she finished by
becoming the fit instrument in the hands of a flamall for the ruin of
the innocent and the perpetration of injustice cruelty and deceit

thus have we seen the fatal torrent of unchecked passions flow but
suppose this wretched victim of their fury had been in mrs hardcastles
hands oh lucy we want no supposition we have seen a torrent not
less impetuous directed by her wisdom to the salutary purposes for
which heaven gave it strength and abundance and instead of desolating
all within its reach it has been led to supply delight and
satisfaction how often has her patient firmness subdued my angry
passions how often has she detected them before i knew their power
with what skill did she temper and mix the warm affections of my nature
with the rougher elements which composed me how sweet how endearing
was her notice of every little triumph i gained over myself and with
what discrimination did she effect that bond of love which made her
children useful to each other her lucys gentleness was opposed to her
rachels courage and horaces selfcommand was the only point to
which emulation was recommended is it wonderful that i have escaped
the fate of a miss flint is it wonderful that i should love virtue and
reverence a faith thus exemplified no lucy but i have to fear lest i
should disgrace mrs hardcastle we may and i hope we shall live to be
wives and mothers let us in that case aim at being something better
than mere teeming animals and like some in that class who following
their instinct squeeze their offspring to death through fondness i am
persuaded that we are weak and fallible creatures but i cannot for an
instant admit that an allwise and merciful being has exacted any one
duty or enforced any one command without having bestowed upon us
the faculties and capacity for fulfilling our obligations every mother
whose mind is sound is called upon to perform the duties of a mother
and without any better guide than her own reason and attention she will
soon perceive that something more is required than merely watching over
the preservation of her children i am and i wish to remain a stranger
to that humility which represses as beyond me all that is arduous and
praiseworthy i believe that by applying my heart to wisdom i may
become wise and the mother who diligently watches over the first
openings of moral existence in the beings entrusted to her will soon
discover that she has the necessary talents for governing them safely
attention and experience will enlighten her and should she never reach
to the accomplishment of all she wishes she will at least secure to
herself the favour of god and her own peace of mind it pleases me my
lucy to look forward to that period when with the name of hardcastle
i may be treading in the same path of duty which our mother pursued in
her road to heaven will you wish me to suppress my hopes that i may
one day be able with the pure joy of an accepted spirit in her abode of
bliss to point to her those inmates whom her virtues trained for
happiness yet why this tear i cannot erase the blot it has made
wherefore is it that my spirit faints you must come and chide me you
will find me paler and thinner than when i last saw you and it may be
less the heroine since there has been less to oppose me but i hate
sea voyages

oh sweet valentine hasten to us hasten and bring to me my lucy thou
shalt then be crowned as the harbinger of spring and horace tell my
lily that we expect no tears nor sighs she is desired to wear the
same face she did with her lilac ribbands we are all learning to be
philosophers except malcolm who is daily in danger of losing his good
humour and rates the work people for not being at wenland at the same
time that they are here i believe in my conscience that miss hardcastle
and miss howard might sleep in the stable for him but we do not mind
his pouting and your apartment which was miss flints is to be made
worthy of the captains guests adieu my dear girl the good people
here send their blessings with

                                                        rachel cowleys




                              chap xiii


                             letter lxxvi
                 from miss cowley to miss hardcastle

                                                           january 

my dear lucy will not expect to find me in the broad road of folly and
laughter with so many admonitions of wisdom as i have of late been
favoured with i repeat the word favoured for poor and weak must be
the mind which does not profit from such lessons as i have had to study
do not however take the alarm i hope i shall escape dullness
although i am become somewhat graver than in the days of my flippancy
and rude health my poor horace but i dare not trust myself with the
subject but is it not wonderful that no one can be found to comfort the
earl of s but his sons friend whose heart is pierced with an
anguish as bitter and acute as his own i am selfish i am ashamed to
tell you that i am become fretful and nervous you must come my lucy i
want you to sustain and to chide me my spirits are weakened and my
mind is assailed by apprehensions which i dare not give to you this
news from lisbon has been hurtful to me i send you enclosed a letter
which may make you smile it did not move a muscle in my face lady
maclairn undertook to reply to it for me she was obliged to answer a
letter of condolence which mrs serge thought it polite to send to her
dear cousin i believe her ladyship hazarded to give her correspondent
a little wholesome advice which will be well for her if she understands
its value mrs heartley has received letters from her son henry he is
coming home his friends death with his dying advice to the young man
make only a part of those motives which induce henry to quit his present
situation mr bembridge the deceased has left him an estate in
berkshire of three hundred pounds per annum and henry wisely thinks
that with this provision and mary howard he shall be as rich as a
nabob with a ruined constitution and twenty lacks of rupees he will
have letters before he embarks which will dash from his lips this cup
of happiness observed the anxious mother miss howard is now in a
very different situation from that under which my poor boy vowed to
live and to labour for her i would not on any account have the captain
made acquainted with my sons hopes he thinks henry is right to return
home but i now wish him to remain where he is for a few years leave
him to providence replied i and enjoy the blessings before you
alice will be soon happy and who knows whether one wedding may not be
followed by another a little money will not spoil mary howard or
change captain flints nature i shall take care observed she
thoughtfully to prevent henry from coming hither i wish alice were
settled i should immediately go to town and wait there for my sons
arrival cannot you lucy find out whether marys colour is yet
lilac alice thinks it is but we may be conjecturing on false
grounds for alice heartley and rachel cowley are very simple girls yet
i do believe the captain wishes to see henry united to him by the
tenderest ties he even proposed the other day to malcolm to wait for
his brothers arrival before he married malcolm smiled but declined
the advice

you saw enough of our doctor when you were at farefield to enter into
the spirit of my allusion when i call him the sun which cheers us we
may say with truth that we live in his smiles should you fancy this
expression too poetical to suit with douglasss stern face it is
because you have not seen him when with a patient who he thinks wants
comfort more than medicine did they inform you that he never quitted my
room during six and thirty hours horace will love him lucy and you
will be grateful amongst other ingenious hypotheses which he maintained
this morning was one that will please you for he proved to
demonstration that miss cowley had the strength of a horse he has
been scolding me for this last hour and has provoked me to laugh at him
and myself

oh how tedious are the hours till i hear from you mrs allen sends her
good wishes with your

                                                        rachel cowleys

p s i am well quite well lucy my cordial in my bosom do not mind a
word in this letter douglass will triumph he predicted how it would
be when the wind blew propitiously


                             letter lxxvii
                   from mrs serge to miss cowley

 my dear miss cowley

it would give me inexpressible concern could i for a moment believe
that you himagine i have forgotten you or the promise i made you
when at farefield hall you can be no stranger to the hevents which
have taken place in my family since that time and of course these will
account to you for my happarent neglect i have endeavoured to
practise what i preach which is more as mrs dangle says than many
who are paid for preaching do for as i have said in my letter to lady
maclairn i see that nothing good comes from sorrowing for those who are
removed from this world death is appointed for all and the best thing
we can do is to submit to the loss of our friends and relations who are
summoned away before us i dare say the death of mr flamall has made
her ladyship very unhappy but time will restore her spirits unless she
do as my jerry do yield to grief and mope in her room my kind
friend mrs dangle would not permit me to remain at putney where it
was impossible i could have recovered my spirits she has a charming
house in the haymarket and since i have been her guest i am much
better and indeed should be quite well were it not for the vexation
nora give me you will be quite astonished to see the halteration a
few months of matrimony have made in her and it will give you a dread
of love matches but i would not discourage you nora have only to
thank herself for all that have happened to disturb her captain
fairly is not to blame because his wife is jealous nor mrs dangle
because her constant good humour make her the favourite with hevery
gentleman but nora was always perverse in her temper she can be heasy
no where now but at putney when single she detested the place she
have been very ill and her disappointment have perhaps made her lower
in spirits but as i tell her the worse luck now the better in
future she may have children enow by the time she is forty

i hope my dear miss cowley nothing will prevent your visit to me in
february captain fairly has very politely offered to be your escort
and desires me to assure you that he will with the utmost pleasure
come to farefield to fetch you if you will permit him to have that
honour but i conclude you will not be allowed to leave mrs allen
behind you so that you will happoint the captain to meet you on the
road i shall be very happy to see mrs allen she will be nice company
for mr serge in our absence i promise you nothing shall be omitted
for your amusement mrs dangle is quite in polite life and she engages
to hintroduce you every where you will meet the best company at her
table for her husband is never happy without society there is a major
ogle in love with you only from description he says that i have
entangled his heart and that he must be our shadow therefore we shall
not want for a beau nor one that half the women in london are dying
for

i would advise you not to make up any thing when you are for your
journey it would be only so much labour lost but it may not be amiss
for you to begin to accustom yourself to fewer petticoats we wear here
only one but we have found out vays and means to obviate the mischief
of going unclothed and we contrive to keep ourselves warm but this as
mrs dangle says is a secret haunter nu for if the gentlemen knew
you were in the habit of wearing small clothes whilst single they might
fear for their privileges when you married you will be delighted with
this charming woman she is the counterpart of you only she has seen
more of polite life since her marriage than you have been in the vay
of seeing at farefield which to say the truth is a sad place for such
a young lady as miss cowley

i remain in the expectation of hearing from you the time fixed for
seeing you and i shall be impatient till i can show you that i am your
affectionate friend

                                                            lydia serge

p s you need not be under any fear of meeting that disgrace to me
lydia i have not seen her since her leaving putney nor will i ever
again hacknowledge her as my child jerry may be as obstinate as he
please so will i on this point you will be astonished to hear that
he have set up the feller who married her like a gentleman and even
sent down a postchay for his ladys use i see into this malice it is
all done to spite the captain whom he hate i am sorry to say noras
foolish complaints have done no good i am sure i can see nothing in
the captain that would not please any reasonable woman and to me his
behaviour is always hattentive and respectful you need not shew
this letter to my cousin sir murdoch have made her quite a methodist

what a shocking end flamall have made but he was always as proud as
lucifer




                          concluding chapter


having faithfully performed my pleasing task and exerted my best
abilities to recommend myself to my readers i do honestly confess that
i am gratified by finding that something remains in which my services
may be useful to their curiosity except two letters from miss cowley
to her correspondents at heathcot nothing appears of sufficient
consequence to this work they being confined solely to miss
hardcastles and miss howards journey to farefield which they reached
in the month of february

it remains with me consequently to supply a few pages to this
otherwise abrupt conclusion of a work already reprehensible in the
critics eye

my readers may be able to recollect the name of montrose the early
friend of mr philip flint who with his sister the wife of mr
lindsey shared in his confidence with the truth and ardour of youthful
zeal and friendship during his progress to miss sinclairs heart

to this gentleman am i at present indebted for a situation in life which
i would not exchange for the most brilliant which this world has to
give for i am sheltered from the proud mans contumely and the pang
which the worthy of the unworthy takes i was in my friends hospitable
house at the shocking termination of mr flamalls life this event
produced many changes in favour of those to whom he had been more
obnoxious than useful my brother lindsey was immediately placed in mr
flamalls office as this regarded miss cowleys property on the island
and mr flint with counsellor steadmans advice and concurrence
relieved her by an appeal to chancery from the restrictive clauses in
her fathers will they being her appointed guardians until she was of
age

in the mean time i was judged capable of educating the young cowleys
their gentle and interesting mother had formed an intimacy with my
sister lindsey during the time they resided under the same roof at mr
dalrymples and to judge of the future by the present these friends
will never have but one and the same roof

in the hours of confidence which succeeded to their first acquaintance
marian informed mrs lindsey of her motives for withdrawing from mr
flamalls authority and power by quitting an abode she loved he had
importuned her with his passion even before mr cowleys death and she
held him in abhorrence and terror she made no doubt of the illegality
of mr cowleys will he having repeatedly told her that she would find
a protector and a guardian for her sons in mr oliver flint and from
the moment she was informed of mr flamalls authority she determined
never to lose sight of her children mr philip flint befriended her
because juba had told him that i was afraid of his uncle her entire
concurrence in committing her children to my care her confidence in my
integrity led her cheerfully to part with them and we reached england
in safety where my trust was sanctioned by their expecting sister and
maternal friend

from that hour i have experienced the comforts of a home endeared to me
by all that can give zest to rational pleasure with an undepraved heart
montrose was understood as a man to be trusted although to say the
truth my friends appear to be governed by motives not unlike bassanio
when he decides on the casket

                           thou meagre lead
           which rather threatnest than dost promise aught
           thy plainness moves me more than eloquence
           and here i chuse

in giving up to my discretion her correspondence with miss hardcastle
during her residence at farefield mrs hardcastle added those
occurrences which had taken place after the day which terminated her
captivity you will easily believe said she smiling that
counsellor steadman was as ready to resign the heiress as i was to be
rid of the plagues of heirship but alice was a wife before i left the
hall and my dear lady maclairn was obliged to confess that life has
its blessings and that the human heart can never want an inlet to joy
until it has banished affection for others she was right in saying
this and she knows and feels it to be truth mary has neither changed
her colours nor her mind with her fortune and her uncle prefers
henry heartley to a rich baronet we shall see these true lovers
united added she when at farefield and then sir murdoch and his
lady will quit the hall for wenland place where i confidently hope
they will find a home of uninterrupted repose

the duke of s continued mrs hardcastle finding that my horace
had enough of the good things of this world and well knowing he had a
recompense in store for himself in heaven contrived to be useful to mr
sedley and by his interest procured for him a valuable crown living
and with his money secured to him the parish of which his uncle is
the pastor and he still the curate such mr montrose added she
with seriousness is the present state and condition of those persons
in whose happiness you are so interested and in whose sorrows you have
taken so lively a concern if as you say the whole tissue of events
before you have confirmed you in your belief of a retributive justice
it is well as it is displayed in this scene of action it may be useful
to others although i am of opinion that not a day passes that does
not add to our conviction that the sinner is taken in his own snare
and the virtuous kept from falling by a power beyond our finite reason
but as your intention and labour will have little aid from fiction let
your fidelity as an historian compensate for the absence of the
marvellous do not omit to say that philip flint and malcolm maclairn
are brothers whose hearts are not divided by the ocean which separates
them they live in hopes of being reunited but mr flint has inherited
from his grandfather so strong a predilection in favour of the island of
jamaica that it would not surprise me if he remained there until he
could man a ship with his own boys and freight it with sinclairs and
lindseys i am not quite so solicitous on this subject as malcolm
added she we are happy now at wenland place besides let us be
content i do not wish my deputy your sister to be deserted she is
kind and gentle to my numerous dependents and lindsey is the
sweetener to the sugar he sends us heaven be praised continued she
cowleys slaves are yet cherished as men though unfortunate men but
i hate the subject

to these instructions i have paid due obedience but i have passed some
weeks at farefield hall since writing the above

and i think it will be no matter of surprise much less of censure that
i should indulge myself with a supernumerary page or two for the sole
purpose of paying my tribute of respect to a character so much
distinguished by miss cowley in her letters to her friend mr serge
was not forgotten by her when she became mrs hardcastle you will see
my favourite when you go to farefield said she and you will judge of
my hasty sketches of the most simplehearted man who lives supported by
the rectitude of his own mind and a piety which rests solely on the
goodness of god he has sustained very severe trials with a patience
and resignation that ought to put philosophy to the blush the loss of
his favourite daughter the prop of his comforts was followed by the
death of mrs fairly who in consequence of a severe cold taken at a
place of public amusement to which she was reluctantly hurried after
an indisposition of a dangerous kind fell into a rapid decline and was
consigned to the grave before she was one and twenty her giddy
thoughtless mother was at this melancholy period on a tour of pleasure
with mrs dangle recently become a widow and captain fairly with
another military beau were their escorts

poor mr serge assisted by his friends the tomkinss supported this
scene and without designing to write to his unfeeling son or to his
foolish misled wife sheltered his sorrows at his daughter mrs
willets leaving to the public papers to announce to the travellers the
event which they might have foreseen before they left home but the
claims of the disconsolate widow mrs dangle could not be overlooked
mr maclairn and his wife joined the dejected mr serge at his daughter
willets and by diverting his thoughts to the final establishment of
this child they had the satisfaction of seeing him improve in health
and spirits he had not however lost his resentment in regard to his
wifes desertion but with firmness declared that he meant to give up
his house at putney and to live remote from london with these
resolutions he returned to town and it appears that he was steady the
lady returned also from her excursion somewhat humbled by the reception
he gave her and probably shocked by the death of her child she made
concessions which failed in their effect for she would not submit to
give up her dear mrs dangle nor refuse captain fairlys visitspoints
obstinately enforced by her husband he again returned to mrs
willets and found consolation his grandson amused him and honest
william as he calls mr willet hourly rose in his estimation some
months passed he resolutely refused to return home without an
assurance that he should find his wife willing to give up her son
fairly and mrs dangles society but this poor weak and misguided
woman had too promptly acquired the lessons they had taught her and
she was hastening on to destruction when an accident deprived her of
life a major ogle who had his hopes and projects flattered by the age
and vexations of the rich old taylor drove one morning mrs serge an
airing in his tandem from dangle park leaving his friend the noble
captain fairly to amuse mrs dangle though a proficient in gallantry
and gaming the major could not manage two high fed and spirited horses
some linen drying on a hedge by a cottage frightened the leader he
became ungovernable the carriage was overset and mrs serge received a
blow on the temple from the horses foot which killed her on the spot
her admirer was quit with a broken arm mr serge received the
intelligence of this shocking accident with silent sorrow he took to
his bed and malcolm was soon his nurse i have outlived my feelings
said the poor man to him i dare not tell you what are my thoughts at
this hour but i sometimes think it would be sinful to sorrow for the
loss of a woman who had she lived would have lived only to have
disgraced herself she is taken from the evil company of those who have
perverted her simplicity and made her the laugh of their dissolute
hours but the day will come when they will remember having corrupted
innocence and misled ignorance her cause and mine will be heard at a
tribunal they will tremble to approach he now determined on his plans
for his future life and with his usual munificence left his house and
furniture at putney for mrs tomkinss use and he has from that time
resided at mr wilsons in captain flints deserted apartments where
in the comforts of a family attached to him and in the society of mrs
heartley who still lives at the abbey he is cheerful and contented
when you know him continued mrs hardcastle it will not surprise
you to find him treated by his friends with an affectionate fondness
resembling that which is given to a cherished child but although he may
be called the pest of every house he frequents such is the genuine
goodness of his nature that indulgence cannot make him forward or
capricious he does not even claim the respect due to his age and
station and whilst the poor around him regard him as their tutelary
divinity they love him as a neighbour and he converses with them like
one his loquacity will amuse you for he may be said to think aloud
and his gratitude to those who in his own words are kind to him is
displayed by the minutest attention to their ease though he greatly
prefers an open carriage to a coach he keeps one because his ladies
want it in bad weather and mrs wilson is not permitted to take cold
when she goes to church for he insists on using it as a family
convenience

my recommendations were too powerful to be overlooked by mr serge we
we were intimate friends in an hour and it has been a source both of
satisfaction and curiosity to me to profit from the frankness and
openness of a mind so uncommon i have seen that the encroachments of
age and natural infirmities may find a barrier without the aid of
philosophy and that in a cheerful piety a man may find a safe refuge
from the cold apathy and querulous temper of near fourscore years
without other aid than his bible and a good heart

our conversations are long though desultory he frequently however
talks of his past sorrows and troubles speaking of his daughter mrs
fairly he observed that from the time she married she resembled a
poor unfledged bird who had been ensnared within sight of the nest and
the wing which had cherished her poor thing added he she told me
once that her husband had taught her to love me i spoke of his
satisfaction in regard to mr willet with whom mr maclairn was so
pleased yes replied he thank god lydia is the wife of an honest
man i do not wish him to be such a gentleman as fairly plain cloth
suits me mr montrose i have worn no other since i was born except
the trimmings are like malcolms of pure gold they are not ornamental
in my opinion tinsel may decorate a fool and set off a knave whilst
it lasts but it will be for a very little time mark what i tell you
fairly will die in in a gaol and his wife late mrs dangle will want
bread and pity into the bargain but i forgive them it is my duty and
like all my masters burthens easy for what should i gain by being
unforgiving

the other day he with much jocularity asked me whether the witnessing so
much of conjugal felicity had not put matrimony into my head i replied
that on the contrary it would probably stamp me a batchelor for life
how so asked he why answered i i see that in this lottery of
life there are some capital prizes but i am too poor to hazard any
part of my fund of present happiness lest i spend my money for a blank
and i am become too ambitious to be contented with a petty prize he
laughed warning me that i might change my mind for such things do
happen continued he at your age i was in no hurry to marry yet when
turned of forty i married without consulting my register or my
reason my good aunt who lived with me perceived i suppose that i was
thinking of changing my condition and she was much pleased
recommending perpetually to my notice a very worthy young woman of her
acquaintance but i know not how it fell out after seeing two or three
times my poor artless good humoured lydia i was not easy in my mind
and thought my aunts favourite miss welldon looked of a fretful
temper and was of too ceremonious a turn for me though she was comely
and only six and thirty which certainly was a more suitable age for
mine and i might have been comfortable with her i soon found that
lydia was too young a wife for me continued he thoughtfully but i
loved her and i well knew what kindness would do with her she was
contented and all was peace with us till she was perverted by bad
company whenever you marry mr montrose take care to know what
company the lady keeps much depends on that and avoid a disproportion
in years there is hazard in trusting too much in some cases

he is very curious in his questions relative to my two pupils who are
his favourites it is all in good time yet observed he but we must
be careful not to neglect our blessings my grandson jerry is a fine
boy and little william very active and promising their mother is an
excellent nurse and mrs maclairn was quite surprised at seeing her a
notable housewife she has been favoured mr montrose there is a
curate and his wife near them that are invaluable to these young
people and i will take care that their goodness shall not be lost but
poor lydia must not be trusted with my boys too long happily she
promises to be a fruitful vine so the nursing will be transferred i
mean to give my children a good education mr montrose it shall not
be my fault if they lack knowledge i cannot reproach myself with
having wilfully neglected my duty but with a more enlarged knowledge i
might have performed it better and shunned many errors in conduct i
have of late been of opinion that i had in common with other men
better instructed a capacity that might have been improved by learning
and i will tell you the reason for this seeming presumption added he
suddenly stopping and facing me it is this that although i cannot
talk nor argue like you and our friends within yet i very often
comprehend the drift of your discourse and am entertained by your
debates before i could make any answer to this observation mr
hardcastle called him and reminded him of the dampness of the evening
adding that he was waited for at the lootable he nodded in sign of
obedience and said to me you may think i am vain but i must tell
you that i perceive what has brought pam into favour here i see all
the kindness of their good hearts it is well for me that i know that my
debts of gratitude will be discharged in full by one who is able to pay
them he entered the house and with bustling cheerfulness claimed his
privilege of sitting next mrs hardcastle

should these touches of my pencil be judged injurious to a portrait
already so faithfully delineated by a more skillful hand i have only to
request the censurer to place the mistake and others as glaring to my
account and to separate them from the labours of a copyist whose sole
merit is confined to a diligent and honest purpose and whose simplicity
of heart has in the presence of the unlearned mr serge a hundred
times pronounced that learning would not have added one line to his
stature

               an honest mans the noblest work of god

it is now more than three years since my manuscript has been in my
writing desk already has time shadowed off a portion of those vivid
colours with which my picture of farefield hall then glared the death
of lady maclairn this spring has saddened every heart whilst from her
dying lessons and calm resignation have resulted a consolation which
all have found useful sir murdoch yielded to mrs hardcastles
entreaties to join her in london soon after this melancholy event
again has she been to him the angel of peace and with renewed health
and spirits he accompanied the family to heathcot in june

it is at heathcot according to sir murdochs opinion that mrs
hardcastle must be seen in order to be justly viewed i think as he
does for it is here and here only that the vivacity and brilliancy of
her mind appear to yield to the satisfactions of her heart she is
always amiable but at heathcot she is more placid more affectionate
and to use her own words never from home

i conceived that this was the season for renewing my petition relative
to her and mr hardcastles letters i could not succeed she saw that i
was disappointed be comforted said she smiling i will if you
please formally announce to the public what will satisfy half your
readers as well as the best written love letters extant i can assert
that horace hardcastle is still obstinate in error and that he yet
worships the idol formed by his own hand an acquaintance with its
defects serves only to augment his attachment for he pretends to find
even in these grounds for his faith and motives for his love

but do you not see observed i how much my moral must lose in its
moral design by the omission of such letters as yours and mr
hardcastles a passion built on so noble a basisshe interrupted me
enough has appeared said she to justify my preference and affection
for my husband my principle of conduct is at the service of my sex the
young cannot adopt a better the moment they know that every approach
to vice and libertinism is contagious they will shun them however
decorated and when they know that by marrying a fool their own gold
will be mingled with an alloy which must sink its value and obscure its
brightness they will be safe and preserve a heart worthy of a good
husband

i cannot help having my fears said i rising somewhat discomfited
and taking up my manuscript it is so unlike the popular novels of the
daywhat should you fear replied she with eagerness why
misses in their teens write novels and publish them they make nothing
of it i laughed and gravely wished that i had their youth and
attractions to plead for my folly and failures nonsense cried she
laughing in her turn i was speaking of their courage not of their
performances imitate them at least in your good opinion of your own
talents and should you like them find you have overrated your
abilities settle the business like our friend sancho panza and say
que sancho cuyer cru bien aussi vte en paradis que sancho
gouverneur my father and the mother of this family as you justly
stile mrs allen wish you to print your work they think your secret
worth knowing and we admire the skill and discretion with which you
have contrived to divulge it with usefulness to all and without
wounding any i bowed and have obeyed

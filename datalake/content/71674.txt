                               chapter i


the curtain rolled down the horns gave forth a final blare and the
whole house rustled with returning selfconsciousness mrs raikes and
miss lewis had always had orchestra seats for monday nights their
wellbrushed heads their high jeweled collars their little bare
backs were as familiar to experienced operagoers as the figure of the
longsuffering doorman they had the reputation of being musical what
indeed could prove it better than their preference for orchestra seats
when they might so easily have gone whenever they wanted in the boxes
of their friends

as the lights went up they both turned to the glittering tiers above
them the opera was a favorite and the house was full though here
and there an empty box caught ones eye like a missing tooth miss
lewis was sweeping the semicircle like an astronomer in full cry after
a comet she had begun conscientiously at the stage box and with
but few comments she had reached the third or fourth when her hand
was arrested there were three people in itan old man in a velvet
skullcap tall thin wrinkled and strangely somber against the
redandgold background a younger man dimly seen in the shadow and a
slim young woman in gray

the curve of the house afforded examples of every sort and kind of
brilliantly dressed lady there were dowagers and young girls there
were women who forgot the public and lounged with an arm over the back
of a little gilt chair and there were others who sat almost too erect
presenting their jewels and their composed countenances to the gaze of
whoever cared to admire

the lady in gray did neither she sat leaning a little forward and
looking down absently into the orchestra so that it was hard to tell
how attentively she was listening to the man behind her she had an
extremely long waist and had the effect of being balanced like a
flower on its stalk

miss lewis with her glass still on the box exclaimed

what again wasnt he with the lees last week

you mean james emmons answered mrs raikes he is not with nellie
he belongs somewhere on the other side of the house he came into
the box just before the entracte rather she than me he has a
singularly heavy hand in social interchange

he could give nellie things she would value i am sure she feels she
would shine in high politics miss lewis raised her glass again you
know she is not really pretty

i think she is only she looks as cold as a little stone

if you say that every one answers but see how good she is to her
uncle

my dear if you were a penniless orphan wouldnt you be good to a
rich uncle

miss lewis hesitated im not so sure if he were like mr lee
besides some people say he hasnt anything left you know

look how they live though

my innocent does that prove that they pay their bills nellie strikes
me as being very short of cash now and then

who is not

and the reprobate son will have to come in for something wont he

oh i fancy not i dont think they have anything to do with him he
has disappeared to south america or somewhere

well said miss lewis i should advise nellie not to take chances
but to accept and then she stopped look at that she added
dont you think that is a mistake

for the girl in gray had risen slowly and disappeared into the back of
the box followed by emmons

he was a short man no longer very young nature had intended him to be
fat but he had not let her have her way

the two sat down in the little redlined room behind the box with its
one electric light and its mirror nellie had established herself on
the tiny sofa

well james she said

i wanted to tell you that i had been appointed to this commission
to inquire into the sources of our russian immigration i start in
september

i congratulate you you will be an ambassador within a few years i
feel sure

her praise did not seem to elate him he went on in exactly the same
tone

i shall be gone three months or more

i shall miss you her manner was too polite to be warm and he
answered without temper

you dont care whether i go or not

she looked at him yes i do james she said mildly you know i
depend on you but it would be very selfish if i thought of myself
instead of

he brushed it aside as one anxious only for facts

you are not really fond of me he said

well i am not romantically in love with you i never was with any
one and i dont suppose i ever shall be but i like you well enough to
marry you and that is something you know

you dont like me well enough to marry me in august and come to russia
with me if he had been watching her face at this suggestion he would
not have needed an answer but fortunately he was looking another way

you know i can not leave my uncle old and ill

will you be any better able to leave him in three months

she hesitated but as if it were her own motives that she was
searching when you come back there will be no need for leaving him

oh said emmons he glanced through the curtains at the old mans
thin back as if the idea of a common household were not quite
agreeable to him

there was a short pause and then he went on

it sometimes strikes me that if it werent your uncle it would be
something else

james said nellie seriously i give you my word that if there were
anybody who could take my place at home i would marry you in august

emmons nodded well i cant ask more than that he answered and
added with a smile though it is a perfectly safe offer for i
suppose no one can take your place

no one said nellie with the conviction of a person who does not
intend to look

the box door opened and a man half entered and paused as he saw how
prearranged was the ttette on which he was intruding but nellie
welcomed him in

dont be frightened away mr merriam she said smiling mr emmons
and i arent talking secrets we werent even quarrelingat least i
wasnt but the lights in front hurt my eyes dont you think at my age
i can do as i like

mr merriam was eminently of that opinionespecially as a moment
later emmons rose to go

goodnight nellie held out her hand dont forget that you are
dining with us on the d

i shant forget emmons answered ive written it down

i shouldnt have to write it down said merriam

ah you are not such a busy man as he is she returned but she could
not help smiling it was so like james to tell her he had written it
down




                              chapter ii


there is nothing so radiant so blue and green unless it be a
peacock nothing so freshly washed and shining as an early morning in
the tropics

a new president having decided to add cavalry to the army the recruits
were being drilled on a flat furrowed savannah outside the city limits
behind them a line of hills rugged in outline but softened by heavy
vegetation were hidden by the mist that was rolling away over the
atlantic and all about them at the edge of the meadow were tall
flattopped trees under which were dotted little pink and blue houses
like toys

the soldiers wore blue cotton uniforms and many of them were
barefooted their horses were diminutive but surefooted and nimble
not ill built forward of the saddle but pitifully weak behind

the instructor was very differently mounted he rode a round strong bay
mare which in contrast to the ponylike creatures about her looked
a hand higher than her actual height her rider sat still watching his
pupils little of his face was visible under the brim of his broad
panama hat except a brown chin and a pair of long blond mustaches
now and then he shouted to the men in excellent spanish and once or
twice swore with the tolerant unmistakable drawl of the yankee on the
whole however one would have said after watching him for some minutes
that his temper seemed fairly unruffled in a climate which tries mens
tempers and in an occupation which induces irritation

once with some instinctive motion of his body he put his horse at
a hand gallop and riding over to one of the soldiers offered some
individual suggestions the man plainly did not understand and a
minute later the instructor had changed mounts with the man and
presently the pony was wheeling hither and thither in response to his
bit as a boat answers its rudder

exactly at ten oclock the door of a square building in the town
opened a little trumpeter came out and the clear notes of a bugleso
appropriate to the fierce brilliance of the morningwere flung out
like a banner upon the air it was the signal that the lesson was over
the men formed into fours and jogged away under the command of a
noncommissioned officer leaving the american alone

he sat a moment watching the retreating backs as he took a grass
cigarette case from his breeches pocket and lit a little yellow native
cigarette then he turned his horse with one hand and cantered away
across the savannah as he did so the motion and the clear brightness
of the morning moved him to song pushing back his hat from his
forehead he lifted his head

    oh im not in a hurry to fuss or to worry
      for fear i should grow too stout
    and i dont care a bit if my boots dont fit
      for i walk just as well without

he stopped in front of one of the toy houses and shouted oh seor
doctor

the door which stood open was at once filled by the figure of a man
in crash clothes he was middleaged and wore spectacles so powerful
that the eyes appeared to glare upon you with unspeakable ferocity
until seeing round them or over you found the expression friendly in
the extreme

ah ha don luis he said i did not know you were a singer

and a poet my dear doctor returned the other bowing my own
words could you hear them across the savannah

i could have heard them over the frontier will you come in

no gracias he answered i only stopped in to ask you to a party
this evening doctor for the lovely rosita it became necessary to
do something to cut out that handsome young dog of a native will you
come

the doctor gave a sound indicative of hesitation

what kind of a party he asked cautiously

oh a perfectly respectable little party returned vickers not a
bit like my last at least it will begin respectably it will end as my
guests please will you come early or late doctor

early said the doctor it is always permitted to go home no wait
a moment he added as he saw vickers preparing to go i want to
ask you something did you ever know a big american who lived on the
pacific sidea man named lee not a relation of yours was he

certainly he is not retorted vickers i have not many causes for
gratitude but that is one i met him only once and then he borrowed
fifteen pesos from me on the strength of a hypothetical likeness
between us

there is a certain resemblance observed the doctor

is there i never saw it what has he been doing getting into
trouble

getting out of it he died at my house this morning

what of fever

no drink i found him two days ago in his hut on the pacific slope
and brought him here one can not drink safely in this climate nature
is beneficent she gives much the doctor waved his hand but she
also exacts much one can not drink here and live

oh nonsense doctor said vickers look at me im as sound as a
dollar

what i want of you said the other is to write to his family my
english is not sufficient to make him out a hero and he added with
a smile when we write home they are always heroes will you undertake
it

sure said vickers swinging a light leg over the mares head as he
stepped to the ground one could see his great height an inch or two
over six feet

you know the doctor went on persuasively as they walked up the
steps into the house that he might just as well have died as you
suggested of fever

fever pooh exclaimed vickers how tame we must think of something
better than that would fever be any consolation to the survivors
no no my dear nuez something great something inspiring my dear
madame your son after a career unusually useful and selfdenying
the worthless dog has just met a death as noble as any i have
ever seen or heard of a group of children no a group of little
children returning from school were suddenly attacked by an immense and
ferocious tigre

oh come don luis murmured the doctor who ever heard of a tigre
attacking a group

my dear seor doctor replied vickers i perceive with regret that
you are a realist i myself am all for romance pure ethereal romance
i scorn fact and by heaven if i cant describe a tigre so that
lees mother will believe in it ill eat my hat

in that case returned the doctor dryly i suppose it is unnecessary
to mention that lee does not seem to have a mother

oh well said vickers in evident discouragement if a fellow
hasnt got a mother that prohibits pathos at once a wife at least a
sister

nuez shook his head nothing but a father he said firmly

vickers flung himself into a chair with his legs very far apart and his
hands in his pockets

now how in thunder he said can i get up any interest in a father
a father probably knew all about lee and very likely turned him out
of the house a father will think it all for the best or no perhaps
not an old whitehaired clergymanlee was just the fellow to be a
clergymans son

i am often glad that i belong to a religion whose priests do not
marry said the doctor let me get you lees papers

they made but a small bundle and most of them were bills unreceipted
vickers drew out one with an american stamp it was dated hilltop
connecticut vickers read

 my dear son i enclose the money you desire for your journey home
 which nellie and i have managed to save during the last three months
 i can hardly realize that i am to see you again after almost ten
 years

vickers looked up why the poor beggar he said he was just going
home after ten years i call that hard luck and then his eye lit on
the date of the letter which was many months old by jove no he
took the old mans money and blew it in instead isnt that the limit
but who is nellie

the doctor shrugged his shoulders and vickers returned to the perusal
of the papers bills bills notes letters from women i seem to
recognize that hand but no matter ah here is another from home ten
years old too

the writing was feminine neat and childish

 dear bob it said if you left home on my account you need not
 have gone

 your affectionate cousin

                                                               nellie

there was a moments silence a feeling of envy swept over vickers the
mere sight of an american stamp made him homesick the mail from the
states never brought him anything and yet somewhere at home there was
a girl who would write like that to a worthless creature like lee

they were using those stamps when i was at home he said
reminiscently but they dont use them any more

indeed said the doctor without very much interest

ten years ago just fancy it vickers went on turning the letter
over and he did not go back i would have in his place if i had an
affectionate cousin nelliei have always been rather fond of the name
nellie can you understand his not going

we do not understand the anglosaxon nor pretend to returned the
doctor you know very well don luis you all seem strangely cold to
us

cold cried vickers with a laugh well i never was accused of that
before wait till you see my letter to nellie for of course it will
be to nellie that i shall write or no i cant for im not sure of
the last name no ill write the old man after all dear sir it is
my task to communicate a piece of news which must necessarily give you
pain i wish i knew how much the old boy would really care your
son expired yesterday in the performance of the bravest action that it
has ever been my good fortune to see or hear tell of as you probably
know mr lee held a position of some responsibility in the railroad
it is a responsibility to keep the bar yesterday we were all
standing about after working hours i wonder when lees began when
a dispute arose between two of the men in these hot climes tempers
are easily roused and words too quickly lead to blows and blows to
weapons we all saw it and all stood hesitating when your son stepped
forward and flung himself between the two i grieve to say that he paid
for his nobility with his life it may be some satisfaction to you to
know my dear sir that one of the boys whose life he saved for both
were hardly full grown was the only son of a widowed mother we could
not make them both only sons of widowed mothers could we when are you
going to bury him

tomorrow

let me chip in for the funeral well have it handsome while we are
about it i must not stay now give me the letters and ill get it off
by tomorrows steamer ill make it a good one but i need time and i
have a report to write for the president on the progress of my troop
have you seen them dont they do me credit

doctor nuez looked at him gravely as he stooped his head and passed
out into the sunlight as he was gathering up the reins the older man
said suddenly

don luis would you be very much of a yankee if i offered you a piece
of advice

very much of a yankee i dont understand i should be very uncommonly
grateful your advice is rare what is it to give up whiskey

no but to give up cortez he is in bad odor with the president

oh i know i know but if i changed my friends in order to choose
adherents of the administration however i am an administration
man i am almost in the army

not always the safest place to be

oh cortez is all right doctor you dont do cortez justice

on the contrary said the doctor i do him full justice i do him
the justice of thinking him a very brilliant manbut i do not walk
about arm in arm with him in broad daylight is he coming to the party
this evening

i expect him

you could not put him off

hardly he brings the phonograph to amuse the seoritas now come
doctor you would not cut me off from the only man in the country who
owns a talkingmachine

the doctor sighed i knew you would be a yankee he said and turned
and walked into the house while vickers rode away resuming his song
about his indifference as to the fit of his boots

vickerss house was on the slopes of the hills and a steep little
white adobe stairway led up to it the house itself was a bluegreen
color and though from the outside it presented an appearance of size
it was literally a hollow mockery for the interior was taken up with
a square garden with tiled walks and innumerable sweetsmelling
flowers round the inner piazza or corridor there were arches and in
these vickers had hung orchids of which he was something of a fancier
in the central arch was a huge gilded birdcage in which dangled a large
brightcolored macaw

you beauty said vickers stopping for an instant as he crossed the
hallway

the macaw hunched his shoulders shifted his feet on the perch and
said stridently

dame la pata

you betcher life said vickers thrusting his finger between the
bars the two shook hands solemnly and vickers went on his way to the
diningroom shouting at the top of a loud voice

ascencion almuerzo

an instant later he was being served with coffee eggs and a broiled
chicken by an old woman small bent wrinkled but plainly possessed
of the fullest vitality

and what are you going to give us for supper tonight vickers asked
with his mouth full

with some sniffing and a good deal of subterranean grunting ascencion
replied that she did not know what to give los americanos unless it
were half an ox

ah but the lovely seoritas said vickers

a fresh outburst of grunting was the reply ah the seorita rosita
i have already had a visit from her this morning she comes straight
into my kitchen said the old woman she expects to live there some
day

in the kitchen ascencion said her employer you talk as if she
were a rat

oh you will see the seor don papahe goes about saying that he
will marry his daughter to none but foreignersthat they make the
best husbands

so they do

oh very well very well if you are satisfied it makes no difference
to me it is all the same to me that every one says this is a betrothal
party and the nia does not deny it

ah you know very well proud beauty said vickers waving a fork at
her that there is only one woman in all spanishamerica for methe
only woman who knows how to cook this side of the san pedro if you
choose to call this our betrothal party yours and mine ascencion

it was a perfectly safe joke for ascencion was a wife the mother of
fourteen and the grandmother of a whole village she did not even
notice the last part of his sentence

and who is there can cook like me on the other side of the san pedro
she asked i dont know her and she hobbled away

after breakfast vickers with the assistance of two or three native
boys ascencions grandchildren who came and went about the house like
stray dogs hung the court and corridors with paper lanterns and moved
the furniture so as to leave the sala free for dancing

these preparations occupied so much time that he was barely able
to finish his report for the government before dinner and almost
immediately afterward his guests began to arrive he had not had time
to write the letter and he could not now catch the mail unless he
sent a boy down the trail to the coast he actually thought of doing
this in order to catch the steamer for his conscience reproached him
but ascencion absolutely refused to be deprived of any of her working
staff on so great an occasion

cortez was the first to arrive he was carrying his talkingmachine in
his arms as he entered and he and vickers had a great many jokes to
exchange as to the rolls fit for the ears of the seoritas

it is going to be the making of the party vickers exclaimed and i
cant thank you enough for bringing it

cortez replied politely that everything he had was equally at the
disposition of his friend but presently it appeared that it was within
the power of vickers to do a reciprocal favor cortez was going the
very next day on a long shooting trip but he feared he would be short
of cartridges doubtless don luis knew the delays in the customhouse
was it possible that he could borrow a hundred or so

vickers asked the caliber and noted that it was the same as the new
government rifle

cortez shrugged his shoulders it may be he said you forget that i
am not in the confidence of the government but we will say no more if
it is not convenient

my dear fellow cried vickers clapping him on the shoulder it is
perfectly convenient take as many as you want and summoning one of
ascencions descendants he gave orders that as many boxes as the seor
might want should be carried out and put in his coche

almost every one had come before the arrival of the seorita rosita and
her papa which partook of the nature of a rite he was a little man
very erect possessed in vickerss eyes of that inscrutability which
even the remnant of an older civilization has for a new one

the girl was reputed a beauty small round barely seventeen with a
pair of black eyes which languished so sweetly and so easily that one
scarcely wondered that their owner never used them for anything else

as his eyes met hers vickers cursed ascencion in his heart for having
instilled her suspicions into his mind for it seemed to him that the
lovely rosita had never languished quite so openly upon him before the
thought affected the cordiality of his manner his greeting was formal
then seeing that she looked hurt and reflecting that if she had given
her friends the notion that he was hers for the asking it was very
hard to be contradicted by his manner he sprang forward and led her
away to dance

soon afterward having surrendered her to another partner he found
himself standing beside her father and never at a loss for a pleasant
word he observed that the seorita was undoubtedly the handsomest girl
he had ever seen and how did any one support the responsibility of
having such a pretty daughter

the old gentleman smiled

it is not a responsibility which i look forward to supporting very
much longer don luis

oh i suppose not said vickers and he thought with some annoyance
of the goodlooking native for whose destruction the party had been
planned

you give me went on the other an opportunity of saying what has
long been in my mind you know don luis that many of my countrymen
are not friendly to the north americans i do not share the prejudice

vickers bowed in his most florid manner i felt sure of that sir
when you did me the honor of accepting my invitation for this evening

yes said the other thoughtfully the acceptance was as significant
as the invitation itself

the phrase struck vickers disagreeably but he bowed again and
prepared to move away but the old man stopped him

i was glad it should be so don luis he said there is no one
to whom i should more trustfully confide my daughters future i am
sufficiently americanized to believe that marriages of the heart are
the best marriages my wife cries out for a man of our own country
but i say no let the hearts of our children speak i do not mind
telling you that the heart of the little rosita has spoken her
mother has not the pleasure to know you don luis but we must alter
that we must alter that he smiled up at vickers and perhaps saw
something written upon his countenance for he added hastily

perhaps i mistake your sentiments i have been warned that it is
the habit of your countrymen to engage a young ladys affections and
to ride away but i can not think that of you my friend i can not
believe that i have mistaken your sentiments

oh my sentimentsnot a bit said vickers hastily even in english
he might have found himself at a loss for the right word in which to
decline an offer of marriage but in spanish well as he knew the
language he floundered hopelessly my sentiments are as i told you
that the seorita is the most adorable young lady in the world but

enough enough my young friend said his companion laying a
hand for an instant on vickerss arm with an incomparable gesture
obstacles are for old heads love for young ones see she glances in
our direction she perhaps guesses what is the only topic that would
keep you from her go to her i will not be cruel go to her and he
turned away waving his hand

vickers sprang after him but as he did so he felt his arm caught and
turning saw doctor nuez

i must see you alone for an instant but at once he said in a low
tone

more trouble said vickers leading the way to his old bedroom which
was the only spot in the house secure from the inroads of the party
he shut the door behind them and invited the doctor to sit down but
nuez did not notice the suggestion

i have just come from town he said your immediate arrest is
decided on the police may be here in a few minutes

my arrest well what the why in thunder am i to be arrested

on suspicion of conspiring against the government you are thought
to have great influence with the men which taken in conjunction with
your friendship for cortez makes you dangerous

well if that isnt the darndest said vickers i have not conspired
against their old government

that my dear luis said the doctor gravely has nothing whatsoever
to do with it they are coming to arrest you the mere presence of
cortez in the house will be enough they can not arrest him without
precipitating immediate trouble but they can arrest any one who will
be of assistance to him it seems he has boasted openly that he could
get all the ammunition he wanted from you i do not say i believe it

i have just sent all the cartridges he wanted out to the coche which
is at this moment standing before my door said vickers

then you must certainly go at once

do you really advise me doctor to run away from a couple of
policemen with handcuffs and a warrant no no i shall stay my
conscience is clear i shall appeal to my own government you know
they cant go about arresting innocent americans without getting into
trouble

nuez raised his eyebrows and through whom will you appeal your
american consul

i suppose so

and do you happen to remember the last time you saw meester b wilkins
smith

oh thunder returned vickers that was the time i dipped him in the
san pedro for saying i cheated at cards well he richly deserved it
doctor no one could deny that

perhaps not returned the doctor but i do not think he will
break his neck to save you i think he will write home that it is
unfortunate that a better type of americans do not come down here i
think he will think it right to let our law take its course

vickers had begun to look grave but at the word law his face
brightened ah there you arelaw he cried they can not prove
anything against me they will not dare to ventilate their case in
court

i do not think they will try replied nuez gently i think they
will send you down to a little prison on the island of santa maria
while they investigate your case and i do not think my dear don luis
that you will ever come back from that little island a lovely spot a
paradise but not healthy it seems it is very far awayso far that
sometimes the jailers forget to come to feed the prisoners for months
at a time

well in that case said vickers with a laugh i should think the
prisoners would not have very much trouble in making their escape

not the least they do not have the least not the least little bit
but the channel is broad there and the sharks are very hungry don
luis

gee you are a cheerful companion you put new life in a man dont
you said vickers

you must go and go at once

i suppose he answered that i might slip over the border for a day
or two

you would be sent back at once we have a treaty with our neighbors
and it is strictly keptespecially in regard to those they have no
interest in protecting you must go home don luis you can catch
tomorrow mornings steamer if you are quick

for the first time the countenance of vickers really clouded i cant
go home he said and then noting the surprise on the doctors face
he burst out why heaven help you dont you suppose i would have
gone home long ago if i could did you think i was here for love of
the damned country

i did returned the other simply yes i am not ashamed to admit
that i did i find my country beautifulmy countrymen attaching i
believed that you felt it too

and so i do so i do said vickers but man im a northener and
id give every palm and orchid in the place for the noise of wheels
creaking on packed snow

all the more reason then why you should go home

look here my friend the other answered if i go home i run a fair
chance of being electrocuted if i stay here the sharks get me or if i
escape the sharks the seor don papa is going to marry me to rosita
there are three uncomfortable alternatives for a man to choose from

i should choose electrocution said the doctor

i think i shall choose a pot shot at the police

there was a moment of silence then the doctor asked

did you send that letter to lees family

vickers shook his head absently

then cried the other with decision you shall go home as lee
ten years might change a man so that not even his own father would
know himespecially ten years in this climate beside there was a
resemblance you know

vickers had lifted his head to laugh at the project for its
impossibility and paused to listen further attracted by its sheer
folly

you must have observed the doctor continued that fugitives are
caught for the simple reason they go into a new country as strangers
and strangers are always objects of suspicion strangers always are
called upon to give an account of themselves strangers always have to
explain why they have come now all these difficulties are obviated if
only you can take up the life and personality of some one else you are
lee you go home to see your father nothing could be simpler well
yes i admit that there is a risk but

but said vickers there is also a nellie i told you didnt i
doctor that it is a name i am fond of

it is a risk nuez went on but to stay here is a certainty

to go back murmured vickers to a real home even if it belongs to
another man and a father and above all an affectionate cousin

order your horse said nuez and ill take care of your guests and
of the police and of rosita and cortez and all the other follies
you have committed

and of ascencion vickers added she is worth all the rest the nice
old hag well ill try it doctor on your advice by the way thank
you for not asking why i dont go home under my own name

the doctor smiled we learn not to ask that question of our visitors
he said and then at vickerss request he went and routed out a small
boy and gave orders to bring the patrons mare at once to the front
of the house

when he returned to the bedroom vickers had changed into his riding
clothes and was stuffing a pair of saddlebags

i want you nuez he said to take anything you have a fancy for
in the house and give the rest to ascencion theres a check for
her and heres another for all i have in the bank it will more than
pay my bills if not write me to an address i will send be kind
to ascencion she wont like my going off like this without saying
goodby but i dont dare she will have hysterics as sure as fate
tell her i love her fond goodby doctor

the last nuez saw of him was a long leg quickly drawn over the
windowsill

the night fortunately was fair for the rainy season had not
regularly set in as vickers rode he thought neither of the dangers he
had left behind nor of the risk before him it seemed as if the fierce
homesickness of the last five years had suddenly broken out now and
that his face was for the first time turned northward he could not
believe that within a week he would see the tops of new yorks tall
buildings rise over the horizon like an immense castle set on a hill

he reached the sea at four oclock at sunrise the vessel sailed then
only as he saw the gray water opening out between him and the shore
he felt an emotion of gratitude to the country that had sheltered him
and which he never expected to see again




                              chapter iii


every one knows that there are palaces in fifth avenue which contain
no one of social note while there are houses no wider than step
ladders in the side streets for admission to which one would give ones
eyeteeth the lees was of this type

at ten oclock on the evening of the twentysecond the groom came
out of the area gate he knew and the lees knew that no one would
be going home for an hour but he obeyed his orders to be on hand at
that time in order to open the carriage doors and generally speed
the parting guest he had already unrolled the red carpet down the
entire length of the steps and was walking up and down debating
whether he could squeeze in another five minutes for an extra plate
of icecream the cook was his aunt when his attention was attracted
to an approaching figure it was that of a tall man in not ill fitting
blue serge clothes but though the month was march and a cold march
at that he seemed to feel no embarrassment over the fact that he wore
a panama hat of large of almost blatant variety the groom counted
upat least two months before such a headgear was even permissible
he had never supposed that such ignorant human beings existed

at this point his scorn was changed to surprise by observing that the
barbarian was actually ascending the lees step treading lightly upon
the red carpet the butler opened the door promptly with smiling grace
he had observed miss lewis among the guests and knew her maida
vivacious frenchwoman his manner grew sterner when a stranger in a
panama hat asked for mr lee his gaze starting at the panama hat
sank slowly to the newcomers feet noting on the way the pair of
saddlebags so casually held

mr lee is entertaining friends at dinner he said coldly

still eating at ten oclock returned the stranger

no sir the gentlemen have just joined the ladies in the
drawingroom

tell mr lee i should like to see him said the other and stepped
without invitation inside the door plimpton who in the natural
course of his profession had become something of a judge of men looked
at the stranger critically and came to the conclusion he was not a
thief further than this he refused to go

what name shall i say he inquired and was confirmed in his fears
when the stranger answered

no name say i have a message from his son

plimpton bowed very slightly be sure he knew all about the scandal
about mr robert his curiosity was so much aroused that a weaker man
would have mounted the stairs with a quickened tread not plimpton he
rose grandly from step to step like a swimmer breasting slow waves

arrived at the top he stood a minute in the doorway fixing his
employer with his eye as one who would say yes it is true that i
have important news but do not be alarmed you are in safe hands

the next moment he was herding mr lee downstairs like a faithful
sheepdog

mr lee paused two steps from the bottom and stood looking down at the
newcomer he was a tall man and the two steps gave him extra height
so that in his close evening clothes he appeared almost gigantic

you wished to see me sir he said politely

you have a son in south america mr lee

the old man bowed

a man about my age and height

not quite so tall i think sir

vickers was silent he had hoped the suggestion would be sufficient
he looked at the old man steadily there was no recognition in the
eyes vickers felt half tempted to throw over the whole game it was
indeed a mad one he contemplated reporting the death of lee and going
away then something in the face of plimpton peering over his masters
shoulder encouraged him plimpton had guessed plimpton would believe
him he hazarded a bold stroke

dont you know me father

the old man caught hold of him with a cry

my dear robert my dear son to think of my not knowing you but how
you have changed you have changed immensely

ten years do change a fellow

ten years my boy you keep no count it will be twelve in june

even at seventy mr lee must have retained some love of the dramatic
for he insisted on taking vickers upstairs and entered the
drawingroom leaning on his arm and saying suavely

ladies i want to introduce my son to you

vickers had been away from home for seven years and in that time the
highest type of feminine beauty which he had seen had been little
roundfaced rosita with her coarse muslins and cotton lace and
now he suddenly found himself the center of interest to a group of
half a dozen women to whose natural beauty care taste fashion
and money had added everything that could adorn their soft shining
dresses their pretty necks and arms their endless jewels dazzled him
he thought of his own little partyof ascencions efforts of the
phonograph of the macaw

the room too was incredibly warm and bright and luxurious in his
eyes the lees prided themselves on its simplicity it was more of a
library nellie always said than a drawingroom but on vickers who
had lived seven years with tiled floors and stucco walls the dark red
hangings the shaded lamps the books the heavy rugs made a profound
impression

even in the first excitement his prudence and his curiosity alike
suggested the importance of at once discovering the identity of nellie
his eye fell on mrs raikes sleek dark well bred as a fox terrier
she was the most cordial of the little group again his glance turned
to an exuberant blonde who stood with large blue eyes fixed upon him
every man has it in him to admire an exuberant blonde he wondered
rather hopefully if it could be she

i am so glad to see you mr lee mrs raikes was saying i had
heard of you but i had begun to think you were mythical like king
arthur

why not say like all great heroes

the little group of women about him smiled only he noticed the men
stood apartthe men and one girl who had never moved from a sofa in
the corner

vickers turned and looked at her and as he did so mrs raikes
exclaimed

what a shame it is we have monopolized him so that his own cousin has
not had a chance to speak to him come nellie well make room for
you

thus challenged nellie rose very slowly and vickerss eyes rested on
her long slim figure and immobile little face

why did not you cable bob she said

he had on his voyage home imagined every possible sort of meeting
between themmeetings which ranged from frenzied reproaches to
caresses but he had not imagined just this

even the rest of the company seemed to feel it was an inadequate
greeting to a cousin who had been away twelve years and they turned
with some amusement to catch vickerss answer

i did not cable he said goodtemperedly because i had neither the
time nor the price

there seemed to be no answer to this and nellie attempted none her
eyebrows went up a little and she returned to her sofa mrs raikes
hastily followed her to say goodnight

i suppose we must leave you to a family reunion she said and added
lowering her voice such a nice prodigal nellie if i were you i
should fall in love with him at once

nellies eyes dwelt on her cousin with an amusement worse than anger
i dont think i shall ever fall in love with bob she answered and
emmons who was sitting beside her could not repress a slight sniff of
contempt

mrs raikes approached her host

goodnight mr lee thank you for such a pleasant afterdinner
surprise goodnight mr robert lee will you come and dine with me
some night i always keep a fatted calf on hand

vickers laughed dont you think ill get it at home he asked

well you know nellie is the housekeeper they both glanced at the
girls impassive countenance and smiled at each other they at
least were going to be friends

even after the guests were gone and the three stood alone on the
hearthrug nellie remained silent

vickers could not resist saying lightly

you dont seem very glad to see me nellie

on the contrary she answered with meaning dont sit up too late
talking to bob uncle robert and with the curtest of nods she was
gone

he turned to mr lee and observed with some bitterness that nellies
manner was not very cordial

the old man shook his head no he said i was afraid you would
notice it you must not expect too much of nellie she is a good girl
but she has not a warm heart

she has an attractive face said vickers

it was after midnight before vickers found himself alone he had sent
the servants to bed and was standing a minute in the act of turning
out the lights plimpton had shown himas one who bestows the freedom
of the citywhere the switch was to be found

his brain still reeled with the success of his venturea new name a
northern home an affectionate old father andabove allnew york
under so friendly a guise he was no reader of the social items in
the newspapers names which had become familiar to half the country
meant nothing to him but there had been something about the people
he had seen that evening which could not be mistaken by a man of
any perceptiona certain elegance and courage which together make
the faults and virtues of good society he had never in his wildest
dreams imagined nellie a woman of this type he had hoped she would be
pretty but he hardly knew whether or not he was pleased to find this
cool perfectly appointed creature with a full face like a boy and
a profile like an italian saint what bonds or barriers were there
between them and if such existed was he ever to know them he thought
of her letter if it was on my account that you went you need not
have gone what did it mean had there been coquetry on her part had
there been brutality on lees

and as he wondered he looked up and found himself face to face with her

she had changed her elaborate evening dress for a scarcely less
elaborate dressinggown she came in sat down opposite him crossed
her legs showing a pair of redheeled bedroom slippers and said
briskly

well bob

he attempted to respond with a smile that should be as noncommittal as
her words but finding that she continued to stare at him he said

you were not very cordial in your greeting nellie

at this she laughed as if he were making the best joke in the world
and as if she were most fittingly replying to it when she said ah
but you see i was so surprised

did not you know that i would come back

so little that i can still hardly realize it

again the doubt crossed his mind whether or not she believed in his
identity with her cousin

it is incomprehensible to me why you did come she went on
reflectively

he answered truthfully because i wanted to heavens how i wanted to

i am glad to hear it she returned i am glad you acted on a whim
rather than from a belated sense of duty for otherwise it might seem
rather ungracious for me to say what i am going to say

there was something slightly sinister in her tone but his curiosity
had reached such a point that he forgot to be alarmed

go on he said

i have done your work for twelve years bob and i dont mean to do it
another instant

done my work

she went on with the utmost deliberation she made not the smallest
emotional appeal vickers had never heard a woman speak more calmly

i see that you think that i ought to have been grateful for a home
i wasnt grateful i have worked my passage it was not desire for a
home that has kept me here year after year but a thing perhaps you
dont know very much about boba sense of duty at this moment i have
no idea whether your father is a ruined man or whether his mind is
slightly unhinged on the subject of money he will not cut down the
household in the smallest particular and yet there are times when i
can not get enough money from him to pay the servants wages it is not
an easy task bob and such as it is i make it over to you

he glanced at the roomat her own extravagant clothes

do you mean to say he began but she interrupted him

dont pretend to be surprised as if i had not written to you often
enough as long as i had any hope you would come back

i never got your letters

odd for you always cashed my checks

vickers was silent his experiment began to look less promising it
irked him inexpressibly to be obliged to bear such a tone from any one
more especially a woman if lees villainy had been on a larger scale
he could have supported it better

you have got to stay at home bob she said firmly

he could not help smiling it does not sound so alarming he answered

you dont suppose i meant stay and be idle she asked no we dont
think idleness agrees very well with you bob you are beginning work
on monday

her tone as well as her words irritated him i shall begin to look for
something to do he said gravely and perhaps i shall find something
to help the family resources out

you need not look about your place is waiting for you mr emmons has
very kindly offered to make you a clerk in his office

he laughed i think i can do a little better than that he said

you are hardly in a position to choose the family resources have had
enough of your higher finance bob you must take what is offered to
you

it does not attract meto be mr emmonss clerk

i am sorry to hear it but you must do as i tell you remember

nellie he said standing in front of the elegant and autocratic
creature does it occur to you that a man may change in twelve years

it does not seem to me that you are essentially different unless
perhaps in your appearance which i really think has improved a little

thanks for the compliment but i am changed to this extentyou can
not dictate to me as you seem to imagine you can i shall work because
i happen to prefer it but i shall work how when and for whom i
please

she shook her head and smiled how like you that is bobto imagine
that fine talking will help you you will have to do as i say

if you were a man i should call that a threat

oh it is a threat dont you understand of what

no

that if you make any effort to shirk the clerkshipif you dont
behave well in it eveni shall have you arrested

vickers who had just sunk into a chair appreciating that the
conversation was likely to be a long one sprang up did she then know
his story had she recognized him from the first he made no effort to
conceal that her threat alarmed him

arrested for what he asked

for stealing everything that i had in the world bob she returned
almost conversationally




                              chapter iv


it was a long time since vickers had spent a sleepless nighta night
that is on which he had designed to slumberbut now in the little
mahogany bed something too short for him he tossed all night contempt
was a sentiment he was not accustomed to inspiring and it sat very
ill upon him fear dislike and even distrust he had had occasion to
deal with but contempt he had never to his knowledge had to brook
his good looks and his ready tongue had gained him an easy sort of
admiration from women his great bodily strength had enabled him to
insist on a certain civility even from his enemies indeed he had an
almost childish belief in the efficacy of physical force

he had been born and bred in a country town in the northern part of
the state of new york near where his father and his grandfather
had been gentlemen farmers he had gained too early a reputation
in the neighborhood as a good sport and the best amateur boxer in
the countryside he had besides a certain social prestige for his
fathers family had once been very rich and very much respected a new
town a lake a street all bore the name of vickers and though this
had been over for a generation some legend of greatness still lingered
about the name

it was all the worst possible training for a man of his temperament
his father sent him offa little too lateto study scientific
agriculture at a neighboring university after three years vickers
was expelled owing to some trouble over a boxingmatch this was the
beginning of his quarrel with his father who could not stand seeing
the name of vickers in the newspapersparticularly in connection with
what he preferred to call prizefighting

the two men had struggled on together in spite of constant
disagreements until vickerss final catastrophe had put an end to the
situation his father did not support him even in this and vickers had
not been surprised to hear that when the older man died a few years
later he had left his little property to a niece and nephew

lewis vickers had left his native town by nighta fugitive and yet a
certain glory had still attached to him he had none of the bitterness
to look back to that slights and small insults bring to a man never in
all his life had he been spoken to and looked at as nellie had looked
at him and spoken to him the evening before his blood was poisoned at
the recollection it was an insult he could not wipe outan insult
moreover delivered by a womana creature he had been in the habit
of subduing with a glance

it did not take all night to bring him to his resolution risk or no
risk he would tell her the truth he would explain to her that he was
not the poor wretch she took him for

he could wish of course that to make his revenge complete a year
or so had gone by during which time she and the forlorn old man would
have lived upon his bounty this would be perfect but in the meantime
he expected to derive a sufficient amount of satisfaction from her
expression when she realized that he was a total stranger having
reached this conclusion he fell asleep only to be wakened by plimpton

plimpton though he had now spent many years in america had not
sloughed off his british tradition the eldest son was the eldest
son scandal or no scandal he respected the heir of the house he
pulled up the shade and drew aside the curtains with the air of one
performing a religious rite

if you would leave me your keys sir before you go out i would
unpack your trunks as soon as they come

vickers watched him plimpton he said i have no trunk

he was very much mistaken if he had expected any expression of surprise
from plimpton he had duly unpacked the saddlebags and knew their
meager contents by heart but he made no comment he merely bowed

no vickers went on i have no bag but in that belt plimpton
which i notice you are regarding with so much disfavor is some four
hundred dollars in american gold i am just making up my mind to go out
and spend it all upon my back if i knew where to go

here plimpton felt he could be of use he had not valeted some of
the bestdressed men in london and new york for nothing he instantly
named a tailor

and for immediate use sir he added as he hung the blue serge
trousers over a chair brushed beyond their deserts for immediate
use i think you might find something that would fit you at hookss
i should not recommend it for most gentlemen but with a figure like
yours sir

thanks plimpton

and will you breakfast downstairs or here sir

where does mr lee breakfast

not before noon in his room sir

and miss nellie

miss lee sir vickers noted the reproof breakfasts in the
diningroom at nine

i will breakfast in the diningroom at nine said vickers and sprang
out of bed

when he came downstairs she was already at table sitting
imperturbably behind the high silver coffee urn

goodmorning bob she said as calmly as if they had parted on the
best of terms i hope you slept

vickers was still conscious of the excitement of his situationthe
strange room the silver the pretty woman opposite him

thank you he said i slept something horrid my temper was only
restored by plimpton plimpton is much the nicest person in the house
he admires my figure

really said nellie and took up the morning paper

vickers let her read in silencehe had enough to occupy his thoughts
but when he had finished and plimpton had disappeared for good he
rose and standing against the mantelpiece looked down at her and said

could you give me a few minutes of your time and attention miss lee
at least i suppose your name is lee plimpton says so

his address succeeded in making her look up plimpton says my name is
lee do you need to be told are we crazy

we are not crazy though one of us is rather sadly mistaken he
answered you did not talk last night in a way to invite confidence
miss lee far be it from me to criticise your social manner but i can
not help thinking that you were not at your best you were annoyed and
you had the misfortune to make me angry too angry as i was however
i can see on thinking it over that you must have had a hard timeso
hard that any man would be glad to give you a helping hand and that
within limits i am prepared to do

nellie had stopped eating and was now leaning back in her chair with
something of the manner of the first row at a new drama

you will will you bob you are extremely kind she answered with
twinkling eyes

i am said vickers i am most extraordinarily and unnecessarily
magnanimous for as i suppose you knew from the moment you set eyes on
me i am not your cousin

there was an instant in which he made ready for consequences and then
to his surprise she began to smile and then to chuckle and then to
laugh in the most disconcerting way imaginable

vickers would not interrupt her merriment but continued to stare at
her with what dignity he could command

you are so delightful bob you always live up to your character i
have been wondering all night how you would get out of this and i
decided on illhealth heartdisease i rather thought it seemed an
excellent opportunity for heartdisease you could easily arrange
doctors bills that would run far beyond anything you could make but i
did you injustice grave injustice this is infinitely better you are
not you but some one else and were you changed at birth or in south
america

disregarding her merriment he went on

nevertheless i am willing to stay here and give my time and attention
to your uncles affairs if they need it and to contribute my share to
the household expenses there is no reason in the world why i should do
this except for the fact that i rather like you im sure i dont know
why for a more disagreeable sharptongued young woman i never met
still the fact remains i do like you but i make one conditionnot
a very hard onenamely that you shall be decently civil to me do you
understand

i understand perfectly she answered we are to accept your doing
your duty as the most extraordinary personal favor is that it bob

an unkind critic might say you were willing to shift your burdens to
the shoulders of the first stranger that came along whether he were
your cousin or not

the critic would to a certain extent be right i do not particularly
care who looks out for my uncle provided it is well done but you must
not be too hard on me bob she smiled you will not have the burden
of my support for i expect to be married in august

well may i be damned cried vickers striking the mantelpiece with
his hand this is too much it was just conceivable that i might be
such an idiot as to stay here and help you out even on your own absurd
terms but to stay on while you go off and marry another fellow

it is your staying that makes it possible for me to be married put
in nellie gently

then regard it as impossible for i wont stay

if you attempt to go bob i shall have you arrested her tone might
have made him pause if he had not been so full of his own wrongs

what folly this all is he cried angrily i make you a most
magnificently generous offer and you have not even the sense to accept
it i a total stranger offer to take upbut it serves me right for
trying to talk business to a woman who is this friend whose clerk i am
to be whos your lawyer is there a man anywhere in this situation to
whom i can talk a little commonsense

mr overton is my uncles lawyer but i should not advise you to see
him bob i have heard him express his opinion he has always thought
it would have been wiser to send you to the penitentiary at once it
is mr emmons who is willing to give you a position you had better
see him

all right ill go to see him and if i dont like the way he talks i
shant come back in that case goodby i have to thank you for a very
pleasant evening remember me to plimpton

nellie had again bent her head over the paper and did not concern
herself greatly over these adieux

we dine at eight bob she said

oh deuce take you answered vickers and almost shook his fist at
her as he left the room

he had as yet no fear that the situation had passed beyond his control
but she had succeeded in rousing an unusual degree of irritation in
him he thought he would experience relief in talking to a man to whom
he could say what he liked

emmons had rooms in one of the upper stories of an uptown club it was
a short walk from the lees and vickers arrived at the entrance in a
couple of minutes but there was a long delay before he was shown to
emmonss apartment

he found emmons seated at his writing table

goodmorning lee he said rather magnificently and vickers
recognized him as the man who had been at nellies side the evening
before

mr emmons said lee sitting down without being asked i think you
witnessed my triumphant return to the bosom of my family last evening
i find myself in something of a hole on account of a foolish trick for
reasons which we need not go into i passed myself off as mr lees
son on the strength of a likeness unhappily i had no idea of just
what sort of a rascal he appears to have been

nature or art had made it easy for emmonss face to express nothing

and you are not bob lee he said

lee died the day before i left south america

why have you come to tell me this

i found myself rather in need of a dispassionate outsider and miss
lee mentioned your name

well said emmons youve come to the wrong person i am not a
dispassionate outsider i have known the lees for some time and have
watched miss lee and i know some of the difficulties she has had
there have been times sir when your father would not give her a penny
for months togetherand why because all spare cash went down to you
it was a dogs life for any woman but she would not give it up until
there was some one to take her place she and i have waited one whole
year hoping we could lay our hands on you and now that you have at
last walked into the trap of your own accord we are not going to let
you go

i see said vickers that like her all you want is some one to take
the job of looking after the old man i had no idea it would be to your
interest too to disbelieve me

to disbelieve you cried emmons do you expect any one in their
senses to believe you does a man not know his own son or a girl not
recognize the cousin she was brought up with you acknowledge that you
come from the same place you are the same age the same height you
walk straight to his house and it is not until you find that your
being lee means that you have got to work for your living that you
begin to run in this story about your being some one else no sir you
will do as i tell you or you will be arrested as you go out of here
miss lee telephoned me what your last game was and i sent round to
police headquarters for a detective you can take your choice

vickers was silent he walked to the window and looked out at the city
which lay like a spiders web far below him he was a quicktempered
man and had had his moment of feeling that personal violence was the
only possible answer to emmons but the seriousness of the decision
served to calm him if he had had only the personal risk to consider
he would probably have gone twice in his life he had escaped the arm
of the law he did not doubt he could do it again indeed there was
something tempting in the mere idea but his soul rebelled at running
away from the whole situationfrom the whole situation and nellie he
gave no name to the strange mixture of admiration and antagonism which
she aroused in him but he found no difficulty in giving a name to his
feeling for emmons he would have wished to stay merely to put a spoke
in his wheel and what did it commit him toto stay a day or a week
he could always disappear the moment the situation became irksome
there was no obligation involved to emmons certainly if he chose to
leave him day after day in the same house with his fiance

ever afterward the sight of a city spread out below him brought the
decision of that morning back to him

well he said finally ill stay for the present

i thought you would well go downtown now and by the way while we
are on the subject i wish to say that we can not have you running up
bills in your fathers name in old times there was money to pay them
now there does not seem to be ill get my hat

left alone vickers turned from the window

it serves me right he thought i ought to have stayed and had it
out with cortez ah rosita rosita your face was round and empty like
the moon but you would not have got a fellow in a fix like this




                               chapter v


it had always been vickerss boast that he had never worked for any one
but his own father and as he usually added not very long for him to
find himself sitting on a high stool in a dark office copying emmonss
letters for him struck him as supremely ridiculous in south america
he had been a person of some importance and the contrast amused even
while it annoyed him

the work was not hard but the hours he noticed were long it was
after six on this first day before he reached home the sound of
voices in the drawingroom warned him of visitors and like the true
homecoming american he stole quietly upstairs to his own room

about seven plimpton knocked on his door to say that miss lee would
be glad to speak to him for a few minutes in the drawingroom before
dinner

vickers was an optimist a thousand agreeable possibilities occurred to
him he dressed quicklyhe had had time for a little shopping on his
way uptown and was able to appear in the conventional evening dress of
the anglosaxon

he found nellie occupied with some flowers which had just come for her
in the long pink pasteboard box of a new york florist she was clipping
the stems and arranging them in a tall vase

oh bob she said without turning from her occupation and the charm
of her pose contrasted oddly with her tone i wanted to warn you not
to trouble your father with this idea of your being some one else it
would probably destroy his returning faith in you and i dont think
he would even get the amusement from it that i did

ah he has not such a sense of humor as that merry fellow emmons you
did not tell me it was he whom my absence has kept you from for a year
no wonder you resented it

i always think nellie observed with the utmost detachment that a
person who is not very strong in morals ought to have particularly good
taste to make up i dont think your last remark was conspicuous for
either

my dear nellie said vickers if i had promised to marry emmons i
should never hear the word taste again without a blush

we wont discuss mr emmons

discuss my revered employer with an outsider i should think not
returned vickers

at least he is your employer which not many men who knew your
record would care to be

ah but emmons doesnt know my record

really bob you are tiresome said nellie do i show so much
evidence of believing you that you are encouraged to persist in your
absurd story there is a proverb about sticking to a good lie but no
one could advise you to stick to such a particularly stupid one as
this

facts are stubborn things however said vickers lee if you care
to know died just ten days ago i saw him dead he died of drink
doesnt that sound likely

very likely if i did not see you before me at the moment

dont be absurd he answered coming nearer to her i knew lee we
were not even so very much alike he was not as tall as i am for one
thing look at me

i cant im busy

by george you will too he cried taking her by the shoulders
you did not have to look up as much as that to lee he was not built
like menot so well he was older too and had led the devil of a
life and showed it cant you see you stupid girl look at me and
he gave her a faint shake

she was not in the least flustered angered or in any way upset by his
violence apparently she simply would not look at him her eyes roved
up and down and sideways but would not meet his and in the course of
their wanderings they encountered the figure of mr lee just entering

isnt dinner ready yet nellie he asked peevishly

not yet uncle said nellie coolly escaping from vickerss grasp
sit down here bob was just asking me if i did not think him very much
altered in twelve years

the old man looked at vickers affectionately why no he said i
dont think he has changed as much as i should expect

why sir you did not know me at first last night

no not just at first though i suspected i suspected but your
manner of speaking is different but as i look at you now i find you
wonderfully little changed just bring me that picture of him when he
was a boy nellie

nellie obeyed with alacrity and returned with a faded photograph in
a magnificent silver and enamel frame it represented a stout little
boy in highland costume in which vickers could not see the smallest
resemblance to himself the old man however regarded it with tender
almost tearful eyes truly the boy is father to the man he said
just the same expression isnt it

vickers turned away with an exclamation of irritation which he could
not repress and nellie asked maliciously

you do not find bob any taller than he was when he went away do you
uncle

taller nellie why of course not men dont grow after they are
twentythree or four what are you thinking of he has filled out a
good deal that gives him an appearance of greater size sit down
here my boy nellie tells me you insisted on going to work at once i
suppose that is right but i must admit i was a little disappointed i
had hoped for one day of your society

during dinner the conversation was carried on chiefly between the two
men

before they rose from the table plimpton approached vickers to say
that mrs raikes had telephoned to ask if mr robert lee would dine
with her the next evening at eight vickers replied that mr robert lee
would be graciously minded to do so and was delighted to see a shade
of some sort settle on nellies brow

the dinner was the first of manynot only with mrs raikes but with
other people indeed vickers hadwhat is so rare in a large city like
new yorka sudden and conspicuous social success he was goodlooking
he was amusing he did not care very much what he said or whether he
were liked or not and the result was that he had more invitations than
he could accept it was the first of april and that short pleasant
spring season that new york social life has lately known had set in
the winter was over many people had gone away but a small group of
those left behind drew closer together and felt a rare impulse to be
intimate the park was turning green the country clubs were pleasant
objects for motor tripsaltogether there was a good deal of an
agreeable and informal nature to be done and all of it lee was asked
to share

the strange feature of it all was that there was a general
understanding that nellie and her cousin were not upon cordial terms
and that they could not both be asked on the same party the result was
that nellie spent more time at home alone than she was accustomed to

mr lee who had always been absolutely unconscious where or how much
nellie went out took the keenest interest in his sons comings and
goings and would often express to nellie a pride in his popularity
which she found rather hard to bear

emmons disapproved intensely

we have no right to foist a fellow like that on our friends unless we
are sure they know about his past

every one does know i think

they cant or they would not ask him though i must say the sort of
irresponsible man he is seems to me to stick out plainly enough

does it said nellie i dont think so if i met bob now for the
first time i think i might be inclined to like him

the reply for some reason seemed to irritate emmons oh then you
approve of letting him loose on society he said somewhat illogically

i dont know what i can do about it james i can not forbid him to
accept invitations

i am not so sure returned emmons but one thing you certainly can
do you can move out of town he will find it hard work to accept
invitations in hilltop and we are justified i think in insisting
that he shall come out there every night

nellie hesitated i could do that she said and yet i hate to go so
early to the country i shall be very lonely at hilltop james

no said emmons for i have decided to take a house there
myselfthe red one i think across the ravine from you

oh that will be delightful said nellie

besides you will need my help in keeping an eye on bob this way he
and i can go up and down to town together every day

you are very good james you think of everything to save me trouble

mr lee was delighted at the prospect of an early move to hilltop he
and his forefathers had been born and bred there he loved the place
he loved the ugly red brick and stone house which his father had built
on high ground to replace the old farmhouse in the valley below he
loved the farm itselfthe acres of rolling country spread out on the
slopes

and vickers too was glad to go a quiet countryside in spring
promised happier opportunities for ttettes with nellie than new
york had afforded him every day in the course of the past two weeks
he had felt irked and humiliated by his position and had been strongly
tempted to slip away perhaps if escape had looked more difficult he
would have been more likely to try it but it was too easy to excite
his interest and though it seemed always possible to him that the
next day would be the last his reasons for staying grew without his
realizing it more and more powerful not only his feeling for nellie
held himfor indeed there were times when the prospect of putting her
once and for all out of his life seemed very desirable to himbut
also old mr lees feeling for him the old man had not commanded
vickerss attachment hardly his respect he was smallminded
irritable petty at times beyond endurance he was ungrateful almost
unkind to nellie but there could be no doubt of his passionate
unqualified devotion to his only son the one and only thing he cared
for was the wellbeing and companionship of the man he supposed to be
his boy the idea of the pain his going would inflict held vickers more
perhaps than anything else the patience with which the old man hid his
eagerness for the younger ones society lest he should be a drag upon
him the amount of thought he devoted to vickerss plans the pride he
took in vickerss popularity were all inexpressibly touching to a man
who had never been the object of parental tenderness

when nellie and emmons and his clerkship were more than usually trying
vickers would tell himself that the whole thing was absurd why
should he stay for the sake of an old man who had no claim upon him
whatsoever and yet he stayed

if he had felt the bond in new york he felt it twenty times more when
they had moved to hilltop

they arrived at hilltop about five in the afternoon and tired as he
was mr lee insisted on walking out a little way over the farm to show
it to his son it will all be yours bob before long to be sure it
does not pay as it used to but its a fine property

vickers cordially agreed and even after mr lee had gone back he
continued his inspection vickers had been trained to farming he
had not been half an hour on the place before he realized that there
was there a magnificent property badly if not actually dishonestly
mismanaged mr lee was not a farmer and had left his land entirely
in the hands of his headman vickers saw an opportunity for efficient
work before him this prospect held him too he came in very late for
dinner silent as a dog following a scent quiet as a cat about to
spring abstracted in short as a practical man just before action

it was with just this dogged energy that he had made as it were
actually with his two hands his cavalry squad in south america there
the problem had been only a practical one here a certain amount of
information had first to be acquired he wanted the farm accounts and
he got them that first evening soon after dinner he forgot everything
elseforgot even that nellie was sitting outside all by herself in a
walled garden lit by an april moon

for two nights he sat up until sunrise poring over the books he had
no other time to give to them for his hours at the office were long
the second evening hearing footsteps under the window he looked out
and saw nellie pacing up and down closely wrapped about in a thin
light shawl for the night was chilly he wavered for a moment and
then went back to work after all this was something definite that
could be done for her the next evening he would take a holiday

it was particularly annoying therefore when the next evening came to
find that it brought emmons with itand emmons not a merely transient
visitor but a near neighbor very comfortably established not a mile
away

the three sat a little while together in the moonlight while vickers
wondered whether if he showed no intention of leaving them alone
emmons would grow discouraged and go home the answer to his question
came at once for emmons rose and said firmly that he had one or two
things he would like to discuss with nellie would she come into the
house nellie acceded without the least reluctance and vickers was
left alone

he took one or two impatient turns up and down the path this he said
to himself was just a little more than he proposed to stand if he
were willing for nellies sake to clerk in the daytime and farm at
twilight and figure at night he would not in between times play
third to her and her fianc

then suddenly the recollection came to him of a girl he had met at mrs
raikessa young and pretty creature with the soft yet assured manner
of the american girl who has been educated in a french convent surely
that girl had told him she spent her summers at hilltop there had been
some talk of his coming to see her if only he could remember her name

a supreme effort of memory brought it to himoverton that was it she
had seemed a nice little thing he would go and see miss overton

as he went through the hall nellies voice called to him from a
neighboring roombob

he came and stood in the doorway the lovers were seated at a discreet
distance emmons had paused like a man interrupted in the midst of a
sentence vickers felt convinced that he had been laying down the law

if you are going out bob please be sure to come home before
halfpast ten my uncle is so easily disturbed

vickers looked at her reflectively debating whether if he were late
she would wait up for the pleasure of scolding him but there was
nothing encouraging in her manner and to be let in by plimpton would
hardly be rewarding




                              chapter vi


he was unprepared for the size and magnificence of the overton house
if he had been an older resident of hilltop he would have known that
to visit the daughter of balby overton was a thing not to be done
unadvisedly or lightly it was an occasion to be dressed for and
mentioned afterward with a casualness only apparent

but vickers knew nothing of thisonly knew that a pretty girl had
asked him to visit her and that an evening had soon presented itself
when he found it convenient to go nor would he for his nature lacked
reverence have been very much impressed at knowing that overton was
thought a great man in the neighborhood he had begun life like all
the other men in hilltop had skated and swum in the river with the
rest had gone to school with the other boys and had not as they
delighted to remember been very wise or very industrious afterward
he had studied law and then gone into a lawoffice in the nearest
large town from that moment he had begun to rise so that the old
conservative firm which had consented to receive him as a clerk was
now generally spoken of as overtons partners he was considered the
first lawyer in the state and spoken of as the next senator he was
known too to have made money

and yet he had never moved away from hilltop hilltop itself expected
it and waited anxiously for the first symptom waited to hear him
complain of the heat of summer or the exigencies of his daughters
education he never spoke of either perhaps political reasons chained
him or perhaps he was not above enjoying the position of a big man
in a small place or possibly he was bound by an affection for the
neighborhood where he was born and bred in any case he built himself
a new house and an anomalous being whose position hilltop never
clearly understood came and laid out the groundsa landscape
gardener was understood to be his official title hilltop on the whole
disapproved of him he planted strange trees and they asked each other
why it was if balby wanted trees so bad he didnt build his house
down in the woods

but overton himself remained unchangedunchanged at least as far as
any one could judge he still came to town meetings and quarreled with
dr briggs just as he had always done it is true that certain people
who had always called him balby or even scrawny for he was thin
began now to let slip an occasional mr overton but he still took
the  train in the morning and the  in the afternoon his
daughter still went among them like all the other daughters of hilltop
and if he had not had a big house and strange obscure but very
expensive objects understood to be first editions no one could have
laid a finger on any alteration in him

vickers did not of course know anything of all this did not notice
the impressive gate or the iron palings or anything until a large
stone house loomed up before him in the moonlight then after he
had rung the bell he turned to look at the view and as he withdrew
his eyes from the soft shadowy rolling country he saw that in the
foreground was a long marble balustrade and beyond this marble seats
and fountains that stood out sharply against a background of cedars

the servant who answered the door said that miss overton was on the
piazza and led the way to the back of the house where vickers found
that he had been anticipated by two young men who were sitting on the
steps of the piazza looking up at the girl in her low wicker chair
it struck vickers that the conversation had languished for there was
a decided pause as he approached but this illusion was dispelled by
miss overtons greeting which was so markedly constrained so totally
different from the manner in which she had invited him to come that
vickers did not need much perception to guess that she had been warned
he was not a desirable acquaintance

he did not allow that knowledge however to chill his pleasant
manner he took his place on the steps although there were a number
of luxurious looking chairs standing about he was punctiliously
introduced to both of the young men and he remarked at once that it
was very kind in miss overton to let him come as he seemed to be in
the way at home

oh i suppose mr emmons was there said miss overton and it
presently appeared that miss overton did not think mr emmons half
good enough for nellie one of the young men said rather gruffly that
he did not think so either and was greeted by so many sly giggles and
innuendoes that vickers gathered that he too had had pretensions in
this direction

vickers contented himself by remarking that emmons did not seem to him
a romantic figure and miss overton burst out

and nellie of all people who might have married so many nice men

the deuce you say cried vickers and was rewarded for his interest
by hearing all the gossip of nellies loveaffairs for the last six
years

he turned to miss overton and why did not nellie accept any of these
eligible proposals he asked

there was a short but awkward pause and then miss overton replied in a
low voice that she understood nellie did not feel she could leave her
uncle

the answer though not painful for the reason they thought was
nevertheless painful to vickers it seemed to set a new obstacle
between him and nellie a woman might forgive you for overworking
her even for robbing her but for coming between her and a man she
fanciednever no wonder he had not found it easy to establish
pleasant relations with her the task looked harder than ever

he had no difficulty in thawing little miss overtons manner she was
a type he understood better she giggled so delightedly every time he
opened his mouth that he felt emboldened to stay even after the two
young men had risen together as soon as they had gone the former
constraint returned to the girls manner she asked stiffly

do you find hilltop much changed mr lee

i find myself changed answered vickers he had no intention of
losing any of the advantages of his position nor was he going until he
had drawn her back to a more friendly tone you see i have been living
among another people did it ever strike you miss overton what is the
distinguishing trait of the anglosaxon race

miss overton who was not quite sure what the anglosaxon race was
answered that it had not

why their ability to pick out another persons duty ever since ive
been here every one has been telling me what my duty isexcept you

but isnt that a help sometimes mr lee the girl asked shyly she
had heard that her visitor was sometimes in need of a little advice in
this matter

ah but how do they know my duty miss overton they all think they
do but do they there are so many different kinds of duty just as
there are so many different kinds of virtue

but are there many asked miss overton trying to think how many she
had learned there were at school was it nine virtues or nine muses
she was sure about the seven deadly sins

oh all sorts and kinds i had a servant once in central america
who was the kindest little chap to animals when my macaw was ill
he insisted on sitting up all night with it and yet i found out
afterward that just before he came to me he had murdered his mother and
grandmother because he said they nagged him

what an interesting life you must have had mr lee said the girl
for this casual mention of crimes was startling to hilltop notions

and courage is a queer thing vickers went on i knew a native down
there who cried when an american knocked him down and yet when it came
to sheer crazy courage

just at this moment a tall figure came through the window

what a beautiful night said a quiet voice

father this is mr lee said the girl and there was a something
anxious almost appealing in her tone

the anxiety seemed unnecessary for overton answered pleasantly what
bob lee glad to see you here as he spoke he stepped out into the
moonlight and vickers saw his long thin clever yankee face just
going he went on glancing at his guest who as a matter of fact had
no such intention ill walk a little way with you

vickers was surprised at the great mans cordiality but his surprise
was shortlived indeed it lasted no further than the corner of the
piazza

i always think mr lee overton began at once that if a
disagreeable thing has to be said the sooner the better now i hope
you will come and see me again come and see me as often as you feel
like it but i do not desire your friendship for my daughter

in his day vickers had knocked men down for less but there was
something so calm and friendly and reasonable in overtons manner that
it never occurred to him to do more than ask quite mildly

and why this difference sir

oh said overton i allow myself a great many things i dont
permit louisawhiskey and cigars and acquaintances with reformed
characters i assume that you have reformed mr lee or else you would
not have come to see us at all

there is something very frank about the way you assume that i needed
to retorted vickers

i make it a point even in court said overton not to dispute the
obvious

it struck vickers that there was no use in resenting insults to a past
with which he was so little connected that he was in complete ignorance
of its dark places hoping to throw a little light upon the subject he
began

perhaps you will tell which incident or incidents of my past you

overton cut him short with a smile no he said i wont in the
first place i dont mean to walk so far and in the second it wouldnt
be pertinent the point is that you are a reformed character in
my experience there is nothing so dangerous to the young their
admiration for the superb spectacle of satan trodden underfoot is too
apt to include an admiration of satan himself in short my dear sir i
dont think you have any ground for quarreling with me because i think
you a dangerous fellow for young girls

it is not exactly a compliment said vickers

either of those young sparks who have just gone would have given ten
years of his life for such an accusation both men laughed at the
incontestable truth of this assertion but vickers felt it necessary to
say

but i am a good deal older than they are

and a good many other things as well they had reached the impressive
gatepost and overton stopped suppose you come and dine with me
tomorrow night and he added in exactly the same tone louisa is
dining with a friend

vickers looked at him a moment and then exclaimed candidly now i
wonder why in thunder you asked me to dinner

overton smiled let me tell you he answered i must confess i was
an eavesdropper this evening sitting in the house i could hear your
voice and i amused myself trying to guess who you could be that i
could not place in hilltop i could not even guess your family it was
principally to satisfy my curiosity that i came out

do you remember me mr overton before i went away asked vickers
eagerly

i have an excellent memory answered the lawyer briefly

do i seem to you to have changed

physically changed you mean

yes

overton looked at him reflectively in the moonlight

more than physically he returned at length

mentally

mentally if you like it seems to me lee that you have changed your
soul and you will forgive my saying that it seems to me a damned good
thing goodnight

vickers went on his way whistling the interview had raised his spirits
with its suggestion that his own personality might yet triumph over
lees it seemed a very fitting climax to the evening when he saw
nellie standing at the door most evidently looking for him

ah nellie he said you were afraid i had bolted

i was not she answered firmly only i did not want to lock up the
house until you were in

nellie he said again you were most mortally afraid in the depths
of that hard little heart of yours that i had run away

i dont know whether i am most afraid you will run away or disgrace
us by staying where have you been bob

vickers looked down at her and felt inclined to refuse her the
information but seeing possibilities in telling her he almost
instantly answered

i have been most safely engaged in a visit to miss overton

louisa overton oh bob how could you

but why not i had supposed it one of the very most respectable

you know that is not what i meant

perhaps you will tell me what you do mean

you must not go and see little louisa she is a perfect child she has
seen nothing and knows no one i do not think she would even amuse you
very much bob she is too simple and innocent i can not think what
put it into your head to go

well one thing was that she asked me

you must not go again

i can hardly avoid it i am dining there tomorrow night

she asked you to dinner

certainly i did not invite myself

there was a short pause and then nellie said with determination
bob i am to a certain degree responsible for your being here at all

you are entirely responsible

i feel the responsibility i feel it is my duty to make you behave
rightly while you are here it is not behaving rightly to try and
acquire an influence over an inexperienced child like louisa overton

my dear nellie how women jump to conclusions is an evening visit a
sure prelude to acquiring an influence

yes for a man like you

be careful or i shall interpret that as a compliment if you dont
change the form of your sentence

you may interpret it as you like returned she i repeat that
it is quite possible that your looks your size your manner and
your adventures might be very dazzling to a girl who she added
relentlessly did not know much about you

but every one here seems to know everything about me to judge by
their disapproving glances

i dont believe that louisa does but i tell you frankly bob if you
go there again

another threat nellie i never knew any one who believed so
completely in government by threat

how else can i treat you

well you might try being a little bit nice to me dont you think
that would be rather more likely to make me stay at home but to be
left alone in the garden while you and emmons

you do not need to be told that you were at liberty to join us

ay theres a prospect to keep a man at home three of us so
congenial sitting up making conversation a dangerously alluring
proposition nellie upon my word

you can hardly expect me to refuse to see mr emmons because you have
come home

i do not say what i expect i ask you to be a little more civil to me
i dont make it a business proposition and i dont make it a threat
like you but if you really want me to stay at home and behave myself
there is only one way to do it

nellie looked very grave and then began to smile

you know that sounds rather like a threat to me she said

then you see the force of bad example i did not use to threaten my
friends

i am not your friend she answered quickly

what are you

if he had expected to hear her reply your enemy he was wrong

it seems to me that for six years i have been your slave

i wish i had known it

and now i intend that you shall be mine

he laughed well you are frank at least but let me tell you that
it has never been found good commercial policy to treat even slaves
too badly your whole position is based on the assumption that i shall
always prefer this house to states prison but be careful there is
many a good criminal whom i should prefer to emmons as a companion
and a warder is tender and human compared to you nellie have a little
common sense my dear girl if i am to stay you must be civil

she turned sharply away from him and he made no effort to detain
her they walked side by side across the hall absorbed in their own
thoughts nellies were obvious she was plainly weighing the claims of
an excellent fianc against those of a worthless cousin vickers was
asking himself for the first time whether after all he any longer
wanted to prove to her that he was not lee if he had the proofs in
his hand at that moment would he show them to her there would be one
splendid scene one instant of triumph it would be worth a great deal
to see nellie humble but would it be worth going away for all time
he had to choose between leaving her a rehabilitated character or at
least partially rehabilitated but still leaving her or remaining
to be despised it struck him with some force that on the whole he
preferred to remain

it was at best a very pretty question




                              chapter vii


when vickers came downstairs ready to start for mr overtons emmons
was just arriving to dine at the lees the two men met at the front
door emmons eyed vickers suspiciously evidently he and nellie had
had some discussion as to the advisability of allowing the renegade as
much liberty as evening visits implied indeed the little man almost
blocked vickerss path for a moment

going out he asked

going to dine with a friend returned vickers the reply made emmons
curious in the first place he did not approve of vickerss roaming
over the country by moonlight in the second there were few people in
hilltop who would receive bob lee into their houses perhaps it was
not so much curiosity as distrust that was aroused in him on reviewing
the situation he simply did not believe a word a state of mind his
manner did not entirely conceal

i am sure it is very nice to see you making friends so quickly he
said

oh i usually make friends quickly if at all and the same way with
enemies as i am a little late he added with the utmost geniality
perhaps you will just step aside and let me go

reluctantly emmons allowed the other to pass but as he did so he
hazarded one more question

going far he said

vickers did not answer he was some distance down the path and
possibly did not hear but it is irritating to be left with an
unanswered question on your lips and emmons came storming in to
nellie who was standing in the hall

where is he going nellie i dont think we are justified in letting
him loose on the countrysidea man like that

nellie was watching vickerss back as he swung out of sight and she
returned rather absently he is dining at the overtons she did not
at first observe the expression of surprise and annoyance that appeared
upon the face of her betrothed

the overtons he exclaimed

now we all know that strangely petty ambitions are laid away in the
minds of even the greatest and emmons had always cherished a secret
wish to be on terms of intimacy with overton whom he often described
as the ablest man in new england but though the compliment must
necessarily have been repeated it had never won for its inventor the
cordiality which it deserved

to the overtons he repeated well you will excuse my saying that
seems to be about the most extraordinary thing i ever heard

does it returned nellie it doesnt to me people like bob are such
a rarity in hilltop

emmons glanced at her to see what in the world she could mean and not
being very much the wiser for his glance answered contemptuously a
rarity fortunately

nellie appeared to be willing to take up the subject from a thoughtful
and scientific standpoint

i dont know that i think it fortunate she replied it does not
seem to me that the absence of finelooking amusing young men is a
matter for any community to congratulate itself upon

it would have been impossible of course that any girl with a profile
like nellies should wish deliberately to annoy another human
beingleast of all a thoroughly domesticated fianc certainly
such an idea never occurred to emmons and yet none the less he found
himself distinctly irritated

i hardly think you would find the community improved by changing men
like dr briggs and the reverend mr fowler for men of the type of your
cousin

nellie laughed i only suggested that mr overton would find them more
amusing at dinner she said

i think said emmons that you are talking without thinking

she seemed at any rate quite willing to think without talking and a
pause fell upon the conversation it was almost with relief that they
heard the sound of the village firebell break in upon the silence
dingdong dingdonga regular terrible sound of warning almost
like a human voice calling for help in the darkness nellie started
up the sound brought recollections of old tragedies fire seldom
visited hilltop but when it came the little town was almost helpless
emmons rose too but more slowly they went to the door and listened

already the quiet night was full of the sounds of shouting and hurrying
feet and then the tinkle of the little hand firemachine the fire
was at some distance for the tinkling grew fainter and fainter and
finally died away entirely

oh lets go james said nellie

a man may be pardoned for not wishing to take his fiance to one
of the few situations where he can not shine emmons shook his head
pouting out his lips slightly

oh i dont think you want to go my dear its a long way off and the
dew is heavy

yes but i do said nellie she opened the coat closet and began
hunting for an old cloak

its probably nothing at alla false alarm he continued but seeing
that she persistedand she could be very persistent when she wanted
tohe added oh very well ill go up to the corner of the road and
if it is anything worth seeing ill come back for you

left alone nellie sat down on the steps of the front piazza and
waited now that emmons had gone so meekly her conscience began to
reproach her for her treatment of him throughout the evening no wonder
he disapproved of bob he was quite right to do so she disapproved
of him herself yet the result of a days effort to be as he had
asked a little more civil had rendered him more civil in return even
if one did disapprove of a mans morals one could not help noticing
the extraordinary quickness with which he caught ones ideas and
anticipated ones wishes he never shut his eyes and repeated the same
thing in exactly the same tone of voicea trick of emmonss which for
the first time she noticed annoyed her excessively it was in the small
things that bob was so considerate of her feelings and yet there was
something ludicrous in talking about a mans consideration for her
feelings when he had stolen her patrimony before she had put up her
hair

at this point she began to appreciate that emmons had had more than
time not only to run but to walk to the corner of the road and back
she went down to the gate and looked up the road there was no sign
of him he had been right then it was only a false alarm and then to
contradict this hypothesis she saw the heavens suddenly lit up with the
unmistakable glare of a conflagration

emmons had played her false

nellie did not hesitate an instant she started out by herself

guided first by the glare in the sky and soon by the sound of shouting
she cut across fields before long she came in sight of the fire it
was in the barn of a neighboring farmer she could see the people
crowding about it and the thick rolling smoke that turned the full
moon to a dull reddish brown

coming up from the darkness she was unnoticed every one was watching
the flames except those who were trying to put them out the first
person she saw was vickers his coat was off and from the rather
dangerous eminence of a woodpile he was playing the hose upon the roof
of a neighboring stable among the lookers on she observed overton
and then the perfidious emmons she might be excused for a feeling of
anger against her betrothed and she was just approaching him in order
to thank him for his consideration of her wishes when her attention
was distracted vickers who had come down from the woodpile was
suddenly approached by a sobbing expostulating child the daughter of
the farmer she had evidently escaped from the parental supervision
and had seized the knees of the first passerby nellie saw vickers
stoop to listen saw him lay down a bucket he had taken up saw him
hitch his trousers with a peculiarly energetic motion and run toward
the blazing building some one shouted to him another caught his arm
and was shaken off he disappeared into the blaze an instant later he
reappeared carrying a small bundle which turned out to be nothing more
than a puppy

a voice reached her ears in the pause that followed

well i would not risk my life for a dog and emmonss voice replied
a pretty even risk bob lee against a blind puppy

the sentence fell coldly on nellies enthusiasm her heart beat
quickly with something very like contempt for the speaker nearby the
child and the mother dog were holding a solemn thanksgiving utterly
indifferent to the excitement about them nellie preferred their
society she had had some thought of saying a word to her cousin but
something held her back there seemed a sort of meanness in keeping
herself aloof from him at home and then stepping out to share his
public triumphs

as she moved back she found herself near overton who was talking to
mr fowler the presbyterian clergyman

the fellows as wild as a hawk fowler overton was saying and yet
i rather like him

it was a brave action returned the clergyman dubiously

aye said overton noting the hesitation a good many of the brave
actions of this world have been done by those the church damned in the
next

i think answered the clergyman tartly that it takes some courage
to be merely good mr overton morality is a kind of courage

overton laughed im not so sure of that he said but i rather
think courage is a kind of morality

the sentence impressed itself on nellies mind she admired mr
overton and was accustomed to give attention to anything he said of
course courage was a kind of moralitybobs kindnot so difficult
and praiseworthy as a steady industry like james emmonss but oh so
much more interesting

she amused herself listening to the different comments on her cousins
action she noticed for the first time how such unlikely phrases as
the young fool or well if that isnt the darndest could be made
to express a very poignant form of masculine admiration she chuckled
softly to herself it certainly was the darndest she repeated
deriving no little pleasure from the unaccustomed form of words

the barn was now seen to be doomed the flames burst out of the roof
licking it up there was nothing more to do except to keep neighboring
buildings wet and as there was no wind the danger to these was not
great

seeing mr overton standing alone nellie drew near to him to ask if
the loss of the farmer was serious

no overton thought not the barn was old and fortunately there was
no livestock in it except he added with his crooked yankee smile
that puppy your cousin pulled out

i am afraid bob was very foolhardy nellie replied not quite
ingenuously

overton laughed why so they are all saying he answered but i
dont know the little girl says she had promised the old bitch to
preserve one puppy when all the others were drowned a ladys promise
is a sacred thing isnt it miss nellie oughtnt a gentleman to
risk his life to help her keep her word of honor he looked at her
whimsically

i dont think a gentleman need trouble himself to do anything that you
dont do mr overton she answered and i notice you did not rush
in

i oh dear no i am too old and stiff but if i had been a romantic
young giant of twentyeight or nine

you flatter him said nellie dryly bob is thirtyfive

overton looked at her gravely impossible he said but of course
you know all i can say is that he is the youngestlooking man for his
age that i know i must ask him how he manages it

perhaps by avoiding all his responsibilities said nellie and
regretted her speech the next instant her position was really absurd
she seemed to be equally annoyed at those who praised her cousin and
at those who blamed him whatever was said of him stirred her to
contradiction

the lights and shadows cast by the fire were very sharp so that
nellie standing behind overton was almost invisible when a little
later vickers himself came up

he was quite hoarse with shouting and was enjoying himself immensely

its a fine sight said overton

what oh yes bully ive had the time of my life but i am afraid
its almost over

nellie moved forward she had not forgotten emmonss perfidy and she
said will you tell me when you are going bob i should like to go
home with you

you here nellie of course ill take you home any time you say has
emmons deserted you i thought i saw him here earlier

yes i saw him too looking on

the same occupation he was engaged in when i saw him in fact of all
naturalborn firstrate spectators

she thought overton need not have laughed and she said bob if you
can not speak civilly of mr emmons

there there ill not say another word where is my coat are you
ready lets be getting along shall we go by the road or across lots

nellie chose to return as she had come she was glad that he did not
wait to be thanked and slipped off without any notion of being missed

they walked in silence through alternate patches of woods and
moonlight occasionally he would offer a friendly hand to help her over
a fence but nellie did not accept it she had climbed fences unaided
all her life a strange impression of loneliness crept over her she
listened with a certain breathlessness to the quiet of the woods even
the moonlight looked different and then she realized that she had not
often seen the full moon so high

her companion too was unusually silent and it was she who spoke
first bob she said suddenly why did you risk your life for a dog

oh lord cried vickers if any one else asks me that every
one seems to think i had a plan i didnt the kid asked me to and
it seemed to be up to me i quite forgot i was risking your precious
salary it would have been a good joke to send you home my corpse to
pay the funeral expensesthe funeral expenses of a total stranger

perhaps it would not have been a very expensive funeral bob she
answered dryly

he was irrepressible however

that would have been a shame for we gave your cousin a splendid
blowouta camellia wreath you ought to have seen itequal to the
best artificial oh nellie he went on you dont know how the idea
of your following my remains to the grave touches me would you wear
mourning for me nellie

she would not smile yes she said gravely but only because i
should not wish to hurt my uncles feelings

and would it be for me or my two hundred dollars a month that you
mourned

entirely for the two hundred

then mourn for it now you coldhearted girl he answered vaulting
lightly over a fence beside which they had been walking and grinning
teasingly at her from the other side he added ive had enough of it
and of you goodnight goodby

nellie caught his arm in both her hands and held it with all her
strength

ill call for help bob be careful no no you shant slip through
my fingers

do you really suppose you could hold me my dear nellie he asked
looking down at her and touching for an instant the two hands on his
coatsleeve with his large hand

for all answer nellie lifted up her voice and sent as loud a call as
she could achieve into the empty night

oh theyll never hear that said vickers let me do it for you
and he shouted loudly help help help shes holding me against my
will wont somebody remove this terrible young woman help

nellie could not resist smiling at his obvious enjoyment of the
noise he was making how silly you are bob she said perhaps she
unconsciously relaxed her grip for the next instant he had wrenched
himself free and retreating a few paces addressed her from a safe
distance

shall i really go nellie goodby to the old house and poor emmons
and to you and our inspiriting little scraps well i rather think
so dont be so sharp with the next victimthats my parting word
goodby

he waved his hand lightly and set off across a moonlit field toward the
woods on the other side

nellie did not hesitate an instant she climbed the fence and followed
him with all the speed of a long and active pair of legs once in the
shadow of the woods however he was pleased to pauseto disappear
into the darkness to reappear at her elbow to lean out and speak in
her ear from behind a sheltering treetrunk

at last seeing that she was getting exhausted without having the
smallest intention of giving in he stopped of his own accord and
leaning his back against a tree shook his head at her

arent you ashamed miss nellie he said to be out playing tag with
an utter stranger at this hour of the night what would mr emmons say
if he knew it im surprised at you come home directly he tucked
her hand under his arm you ought to have been in bed two hours ago

and nellie somewhat bewildered but very tired allowed herself to be
led home




                             chapter viii


emmons stopped at the lee house the next morning on his way to the
train vickers fortunately had already left emmons came in reality
to explain but like so many of us he made the mistake of thinking
that his explanation would be strengthened by a little reproach

well he said i came to find out whether you got home safely i was
really alarmed nellie when i heard you had been at the fire after
all i dont at all like the idea of your running about the country by
yourself after nightfall

i dont think there was much danger james

you dont let me tell you we are all very much afraid something
dreadful happened after the fire several of us heard hideous screams
in the direction of simms woods

what did you do

we went there of course but we could not find anything they ceased
in as mysterious a way as they began some of the men went out at
sunrise today to search the woods i have not heard whether they found
anything but you will see the folly of imagining a place safe just
because you have always lived there i have been anxious all night i
kept imagining it might be you

bob took me home she answered quickly

well as long as youre safe thats all i care about i just stopped
in he ended moving slowly down the steps but at the foot he could
not resist adding

i suppose you saw that grandstand play of your cousins

yes

and what did you think of it

he looked at her insisting on an answer and after a moment got it

i thought james that you would never have done anything so foolish

i most certainly would not he returned and he had walked as far as
the corner before it struck him that as an answer it was not entirely
satisfactory but it seemed too late to go back

later in the morning she had a visit from louisa overton who drove
over from her own house in her umbrellatopped phaeton with the bay
cobs which her father had so carefully selected for her she came
as she explained to welcome her dear nellie but her dear nellie
noted with uneasiness the unusual promptitude of the visit there
could not of course be the smallest chance of seeing bob at that
hour but nellies heart sank as she observed how often her cousins
name was introduced into the conversation it seemed to grow up
spontaneously like a weed and yet nellie was sufficiently experienced
in the peculiarities of her own sex to know it was a dangersignal
she wondered if the time had come for delivering the warning against
her cousin which emmons had advocated she felt strangely adverse to
delivering it

she tried a new mode of attack as the girl rose to go after a final
comment on vickerss conduct at the fire

upon my word louisa she said goodtemperedly bob seems to have
made a most flattering impression on you

miss overton smiled he is a charming person she answered apropos
mrs raikes says that the three best things in the world are a good
novel a muskmelon and a handsome cousin

she has not the last i am sure or she would have learned to value it
less highly nellie returned

miss overton did not immediately answer they had walked to the front
door and as she climbed into her trap she observed that it was warm

nellie put up her hand to her face it was warm she hoped her own
heightened color had not suggested louisas remark

the heat she could see wore on her uncle he looked older and frailer
than ever even vickers showed it after three almost sleepless nights
and emmonss temper she thought was not quite as smooth as usual he
scolded her about overtons manner to bob the great man had actually
sought him out in the train and had been seen walking along the
platform with a hand through his arm emmons thought it a mistake to
show approval of such a person as bob

really i think you are a little too severe james she answered and
all she could say for herself was that she showed less irritation than
she felt it seems hard if as long as bob is behaving well he should
be denied all human companionship

oh if you consider that bob is entirely rehabilitated by two or three
weeks without actual crime

nellie turned away she thought the heat was affecting her temper too
mr lees slavish devotion and emmonss continual criticism of her
cousin alike angered her she found herself wondering whether james
were not rather a trying employerwhether he did not take it out of
bob down town for the first time she felt a little sorry for her
cousin at least he never complained

he did not complain but a steady contempt for emmons grew in his
minda contempt which would have been hatred if he had really been as
bound down as emmons thought him as it was he still played daily with
the idea of flight certainly he told himself he would wait no longer
than to get the farm on its feet under a new farmer

to make the situation more trying his friendship with overton had not
been without results he and the great man had had several long talks
over the farm and the condition of mr lees affairs overton had
been impressed the morning after louisas visit to nellie he had
offered vickers a position of some importance the offer gave vickers
satisfaction as the lees lawyer mr overton must know all about
bob lees past vickers felt that at last his own individuality had
overcome bobs nevertheless he had declined the position would have
taken him to another city he saw that overton was puzzled and not
very much pleased at his refusal

if the difficulty is with your father he said gently i think i
could arrange that for you

vickers said that it was not with his father and overton said no more
vickers was sorry to see that he had lost ground

he came up by a later train than usual he felt put out with life and
with himself and stood frowning on the station platform looking for
the trap that would take him to the house when suddenly he saw that
not the coachman but nellie was driving it for an instant his heart
bounded he looked round to see if emmons were there too but few
people patronized the late train he was alone on the platform when
nellie drew up beside it

if any one had asked me in the train he said what was the most
unlikely thing in the world i should have answered that nellie
should come and meet me

to his surprise she assented quite gravely i wanted to see you before
you went home there is a man at the house asking for you

what sort of a man

a very queerlooking man boban old man he speaks very little
english and has very dangerouslooking eyes

whats his name said vickers he had begun to be nervous about lees
past he could not tell what was about to overtake him

he wont give his name he just bows and says to tell you a
gentleman he keeps calling you don luis and then correcting himself
and saying meester bob lee

the deuce said vickers he thought for a moment that the seor don
papa and the lovely rosita had found him out is he old he asked

yesmiddleaged or more then seeing his obvious anxiety nellie
went on quickly and so i thought bob if it were anything very
badi mean if you did not want to see him that you might go on to mr
overtons and i would tell him you had gone away

tell a lie nellie

oh dont be stupid and irritating bob my uncle has not been well
lately he could not bear anything more it is of him i am thinking it
would be too terrible if if

if they jugged me at last well i dont think that they will

his lightheartedness did not entirely relieve her mind and at their
own gate she stopped again

do be careful think before you go in bob she said and then
seeing him smiling she added oh i almost wish you had never come
back at all

what he cried am i more trouble than the two hundred dollars a
month is worth

yes she answered crossly

perhaps if you will tell that to emmons he will raise my salary

she was not at all amused bob she said as she drew up before the
door dont go in i really do not feel as if i could bear another
scandal dont be foolhardy this man is terribly mysterious

why you excite my curiosity he said and gently putting her out
of his path he went into the house ahead of her and found himself
confronted by doctor nuez

the ensuing conference was long dinner came and went but still
vickers was shut up in the little library with his strange visitor mr
lee had gone to bed emmons had long since arrived but his fiance
gave him but a strained attention she sat listening for the opening of
the library door if the voices within were raised enough to become
audible she thought that a quarrel was in progress if they sank the
silence terrified her more

now some people like a straight southerly exposure emmons was
saying but give me a southwesterly you get the sun in

nellie suddenly stood up what can they be doing she said that
queerlooking man has been here over three hours

up to no good the two of them i have no doubt said emmons and
added i hope you dont keep much money in the house

she turned on him sharply how absurd you are james you cant
suppose but she was cut short by the opening of the library door
and the sound of the two mens voices as they crossed the hall

do you know any spanish james she asked quickly

emmons shook his head

i speak no language but my own he answered proudly

as the front door shut nellie left him unceremoniously and went out
to the front piazza where vickers was standing after having said
goodby to his visitor his head was bent and his hands were in his
pockets

nellie came and stood silently beside him she was conscious of being
nervous she could feel her heart beating she felt that something
important had happened they stood like this for several seconds and
then fearing that emmons would join them before she had heard nellie
said

bob

the monosyllable was plainly a question but he did not answer it he
merely took her hand and drew it within his arm and continued to stare
meditatively at the boards at his feet

driven to desperation by the thought of the shortness of her time
nellie at length asked

was it very serious

he looked at her

pretty serious nellie

she felt frightened

i dont want to be too curious but you must tell me are you in
danger

i am in danger he answered of the only thing which at the moment i
fear i am in danger of having to leave you

she withdrew her hand quickly and stepped back he made no effort to
detain her

yes he said go back to emmons or we shall have him ramping out
here to know what the matter is i am going up to the overtons

nellie turned and went into the house

emmons was sitting with his elbows on his knees tapping his feet up
and down so as to give a rocking motion to his whole body he did not
like being left alone

and where is bob he asked

gone out and nellie added more candidly gone to the overtons

oh of course naturally retorted emmons and may i ask who his
visitor was

he did not tell me

he has gone i suppose to confide it to louisa overton

nellie looked at him quickly she had not phrased the notion quite so
clearly to herself and yet it had been there bob had never mentioned
louisa overtons name and yet his cousin could not be ignorant that
he was at the overtons house almost every day she glanced at james
would any one turn to james in a crisis she thought all this before
she became aware that he was saying

i think we shall have to inquire into this a little more there is
something behind these constant visits to the overtons if i am not
very much mistaken why a clever man like balby overton allows it is
more than i can see is it possible that miss louisa can have taken a
fancy to him is it possible that any decent girl could take a fancy to
him

there was a long pause perhaps nellie was not listening for he had to
repeat his question before he got an answer

very possible i should think

the answer did not please emmons

well not so very possible he said contemptuously i am afraid the
kind of man he is sticks out plainly enough inexperienced as she is
i fancy she can see his gamean heiress and so young i should feel
responsible if anything happened unless i had said a word to overton
oh yes i know you suppose that he knows all about bobs record
but in a case as serious as this we have no right to suppose it is
somebodys duty to speak plainly and if you wont do it why i will

i am the person to do it if it must be done said nellie

i am not so sure of that there are very pertinent little incidents in
your cousins past which i hope you dont know but which you certainly
could not repeat

i know quite enough im afraid she answered with a sigh

oh well dont sigh over it said emmons if you feel so badly
about it ill go myself

no she returned firmly i will see mr overton tomorrow i promise
you i will james

there was a short pause

now about that baywindow emmons began but glancing at his
betrothed he was surprised to observe tears in her eyes she rose to
her feet

suppose you go home james she said not unkindly i feel tired i
think ill go to bed

i can see that blackguard worries you said emmons but he obeyed

yet strangely enough after his departure she did not go to bed but sat
on in the little parlor trying to read but her chin was often raised
from her book to listen for footsteps at eleven she went upstairs but
she was still awake when after midnight she heard vickers return




                              chapter ix


procrastination is the thief of more than timeit is only too often
the thief of opportunity vickers who knew very well that he might
have made his escape any time in the course of the last month if only
he had been sure he wanted to now saw before him the prospect of
making a more hurried flight than suited his purpose he had allowed
himself to drift had asked how the present situation was to end
without attempting any answer and now he had to give an answer within
a few days

he found overton in his library books mostly in calfskin covers
stood on shelves that ran almost to the ceiling overton was
readingnot one of those heavy volumes but a modern novel in a
flaming cover

well young man he said looking up without surprise for it was
no longer unusual for vickers to come in like this i warn you that
i am in a romantic mood i dont know that i care to talk to common
everyday mortals like you i wish i had lived when men wore ruffles and
a sword then you got romance at first hand

well ill tell you what it is balby g overton said vickers
there is just one place you dont want romance and that is right here
in your own life and that is where i have got it at the moment and
ive come to you to help me get it out

you talk as if it were a bad tooth returned overton

will you extract it

the other smiled not a little of a lawyers business he said is
extracting romance from the lives of his clients

its a lawyers business too to know when people are lying and
when they are telling the truth isnt it i hope so for i am going to
tell you a yarn which sounds uncommonly impossible

you encourage me to think it may be amusing

vickers laughed well it begins well he said in the first place
i am not bob lee

indeed said overton let me congratulate you

it was impossible to tell from his tone whether he believed the
statement or not and vickers made no attempt to determine but went on
with his story

he told with a gravity unusual in him of the death of lee and the
incidents which had led him to assume the dead mans personality when
he had finished there was a pause overton smoked on without looking at
him until at last he observed

vickersi was once counsel for a railroad that had a station of that
name i think

vickerss crossing it was called after my grandfather lemuel
vickers the name is well known in the northern part of new york

but there is still one point not clear to me said overton why is
it that you did not come home under the interesting and wellknown name
of vickers

is that really difficult for the legal mind to guess

but overton would not guess a desire for change he suggested an
attraction to the name of lee

the simple fact that i had committed a crime

of which a jury acquitted you

i had not sufficient confidence in the jury to leave it to them

what you ran away

i did

and what was the crime

i had killed a man

nothing could be calmer than overtons expression but at this he
raised his eyebrows murder he said manslaughter homicide with
what intent

with none i did not mean to kill the fellow i knocked him down in a
good cause

a woman of course

at the earnest entreaty of his wife whom he was chasing round the
room with a knife

and is it possible said overton that the juries in the northern
part of the state of new york are so unchivalrous as to convict a man
who kills in such circumstances

so little did i suppose so returned vickers that i gave myself up
as soon as i found the man was dead

but later you regretted having done so

you bet i did the lady in the case went on the stand and testified
that my attack was unprovoked and murderous

these people were your friends

well the woman was

i understand that made it more awkward

oh lots of things made it awkward you see i had broken in a window
when i heard her screams besides every one wanted to know how i came
to be passing along an unfrequented road at one oclock in the morning
in short i saw that there was only one thing for me to do if i wanted
to save my precious neck i broke jail one night and slipped over the
canadian border and from there managed to get to central america

you still had some friends left i see said overton with a smile i
suppose it is for legal advice that you have come to me

no you are wrong answered vickers i have not finished my story
i came north with a real desire to settle downwith a real enthusiasm
for a northern home i thought i should like to jolly an old father
and a pretty cousin for the rest of my life

how did you know she was pretty

well i wasnt mistaken was i but what happened lee turned out to
be a rotten bad lot i have been very much disappointed in bob lee mr
overton he is not a pleasant fellow to impersonate i can tell you

his record is not a desirable one i believe answered the lawyer

i dont know whether you have heard that among other things he stole
the small capital left to his cousin vickers went on

yes i have heard it rumored

as you may imagine that did not help the home atmosphere it did not
tend to make nellie cordial in fact you must often have wondered
at my indifference to your offers of better positions nellie had
threatened to have me arrested as a thief if i should attempt to leave
hilltop and though it would not have been very difficult to prove that
i was not lee it would have been confoundedly awkward to defend myself
as vickers and be extradited back to new york

yes it is a pretty predicament said overton but there are still
some minor points i do not understand for instance i cant see any
reason why you have not told your cousinmiss nellie i meanthat you
are not lee

why i have i did at once she laughed in my face and intimated that
i had always been an infernal liar you see one of the troubles is
that as soon as i told them that i was lee every one remembered me
perfectly why sir it was like a ray of light when you said you
found me changed no one else did

i see said overton and now one thing more why didnt you bolt at
once

ive just told you

what a threat of arrest hardly strong enough as a motive for a man
like you you have taken bigger risks than that in your time why did
you not take the chance now

vickers paused and a slight frown contracted his brow it would be
hard to say he began and stopped again the two men looked at each
other and overton smiled

might i offer a possible explanation he said

oh very well returned vickers yes i dont want to leave her is
that so odd

so natural that i guessed before you said it you are in fact in
love with her

i suppose that is about what it amounts to the other said and added
with more vigor and if i stay here another day i shall do bodily
violence to the man she is engaged to

in that case remarked overton dispassionately i advise you to go
emmons is an honest able little fellow who will take care of her and
her life has not been an easy one

dont say that to me said vickers the mere idea of his taking care
of her sickens me for that matter i could take care of her myself

possibly said overton but by your own showing you would have to
choose your state

vickers rose and began to walk up and down the room well he
observed at length if you advise me to go without even having heard
the offer that tempts methis evening a very good old friend of
mine turned up from central america it seems they have been having
an election down therean election which bears some resemblance to a
revolution a fellow called cortez has been elected

odd murmured the lawyer i read the item in the paper without the
smallest interest

i have known cortez for some time and served him once or twice he
sends up to offer me a generalship in his little armya general of
cavalry but i must take saturdays steamer

plenty of time this is only monday

plenty of timeif i am going

is it a pretty uniform

i tell you the offer tempts me retorted vickers

overton rose too my dear fellow he said of course you are going
to accept it heaven knows i shall be sorry to see you leave hilltop
but no good will come of your staying go tonightat once be on the
safe side let me see he drew out his watch the last train has gone
a few minutes since on this road but there is a branch about five
miles from here that has a train about ten you can catch that get
into my trap and ill drive you over there with one of my trotters

why the deuce should i go tonight said vickers stepping back as if
to avoid overtons enthusiasm

the sooner the better if you dont go now how do we know you will
ever go

vickers did not look at his friend at least he said i must go
back to the house and get my things

my dear man she wont be up at this time of night

i dont expect to see her i dont even know that i want to see her
again but i must get some money and clothes i wont trouble you ill
walk the five miles he moved toward the door

overton held out his hand goodby he said with a good deal of
feeling

goodby sir said vickers and he added by the way did you
believe that story of mine

yes said overton i did

after the door closed he repeated to himself yes by jove i did
but i wonder if i shant think myself a damned fool in the morning

but the processes of belief and disbelief are obscure and overton
so far from finding his confidence shaken woke the next morning with
a strong sense of the reality of vickerss story so strong indeed
that he turned a little aside from his shortest road to the station in
order to drive past the lees house and see if there were any signs
of catastrophe there

there were nellie was standing at the door and though to the casual
observer she might have seemed to be standing calmly to overtons eyes
she betrayed a sort of tense anxiety he pulled up

anything wrong miss nellie

my uncle is illvery ill im afraid she answered and then as he
jumped out of his brougham and came to her side she went on its his
heart the doctor is not very hopeful

dear dear said overton i am very sorry to hear that but
inwardly he was wondering whether he had not advised vickers wrongly
if the old man died he would have been free to go openly under the
name of lee can i do anything for you he asked aloud

no thank you nellie answered my uncle is asleep now and dr
briggs will be back before long and then a sudden thought striking
her she asked have you a spare minute mr overton

he said that all his time was at her disposal

then you can do something for me come into the house i want to say
something to you if my uncle had not been taken ill i should have
come to pay you a visit today

i am sorry i was done out of a visit from you he returned he
signaled to his man to wait and followed her into the little library
where only the evening before vickers had had his interview with nuez

she shut the door and though she smiled a little as she did so
plainly it was only to relieve the effect of her fateful manner

it wasnt going to be just a friendly call she said i have
something to tell you and i hate to say it she hesitated and then
went on again you have been very kind to bob mr overton

overtons conscience gave a twinge did she know that he had advised
his escape oh i dont know about that he said i have had an
extraordinary amount of pleasure out of his company

he is a pleasant companion said the girl but i do not know whether
you know much about his real self

overton laughed why miss nellie he said i was just thinking that
same thing about you

yes she agreed of course it must be absurd to you for me to
be offering advice considering your knowledge of the world and my
ignorance

knowledge of the world said overton is not entirely a matter of
experience i should often prefer to trust the opinion of the most
innocent women to that of experienced men am i to understand that you
entirely distrust your cousin

how was it possible that she could be ignorant of vickerss escape or
had it failed

no answered nellie i dont distrust him entirely but you see in
small superficial things bob has such unusually nice qualities that one
forgets last night when my uncle was taken ill

overton looked up quickly oh your uncle was taken ill last night
was he at what hour

about one i think i went and called bob and asked him to go for the
doctori was very much alarmed at my uncles conditionand in the
most surprisingly short time bob had dressed and gone out and come
back again it was like a conjurors trick and he has been so kind
throughout this dreadful night and yet she paused and gave a
little sigh

where is bob at this moment said overton

oh with his father uncle robert will not let him leave him for an
instant

overton did not answer he felt unreasonably annoyed with nellie for
her attitude toward vickers the younger mans avowal of love rang
in his ears she ought to be able to tell a man when she saw one he
thought

he stood up well i suppose i cant see him then

his tone did not please nellie nor the ease with which he dismissed
her warning

but i have not finished what i wanted to say she returned

forgive me you wished to warn me still further against the
contaminating influence of your cousin

i wanted to do nothing so futile said nellie with spirit i had
not come to the point yet it was of louisa that i was thinking

of louisa he repeated

nellie nodded i do not think that he is a good or safe friend for
louisa she said you may tell me it is none of my business but i am
largely responsible for his being here and james and i both thought i
ought to speak to you

am i to understand that emmons thinks your cousin likely to attract
louisa

james oh i dont know whether jamess opinion on that point would be
very valuable but i do

you surprise me said overton

i know it must surprise you to realize that women should ever be
attracted by men they can not respect and yet it does sometimes
happen mr overton for myself i can not imagine it but i know there
are girls to whom a mans mere charm

oh but you misunderstand me entirely said overton of course i
have seen quantities of just such cases as you have in mindhandsome
scoundrels who fascinated every woman they came in contact with but
surely you do not think your cousin such a person

very much such a person

overton wagged his head well well you surprise me he returned a
jovial amusing fellowa favorite with men perhaps but what would
you say a girl could see in him

his malice was rewarded as malice ought not to be

why said nellie rather contemptuously think a moment in the first
place his looks any girl at least any very young girl might easily
be carried away by such striking good looks

humph said overton pushing out his lips dubiously you think him
goodlooking

dont you

a wellbuilt figure he answered yielding a point

an unusually wellshaped head and a wonderful line of jaw said
nellie i may be prejudiced against bob but i never denied him looks

well said overton well grant him looks has he anything else

yes replied the girl the fact that he is amusing seeing him as i
do day in and day out i realize how unfailingly pleasant and kind he
isin small things and then he has another quality more difficult to
definea sort of humorous understanding of another persons point of
view which leads to a kind of intimacy whatever your intention may
be

bless me cried overton you begin to alarm me i fear you are
describing a pretty dangerous fellow my only consolation is that
louisa has never mentioned his name nor indeed done anything to make
me think she was interested in him

nellie did not look relieved perhaps she answered it is not the
sort of thing that a father is the first person to know

overton shook his head sadly as he rose to go

perhaps not he agreed perhaps one is not always the first person
to know it oneself and he hastily took his departure

as he was going out he met emmons who stopped him and after a brief
interchange on the subject of mr lees illness observed that he had
been wanting a few words with mr overton for some days

about bob lee mr overton do you know his past history

i do said overton he held up his hand and signaled to his coachman

to so simple an answer emmons for a moment could think of nothing to
say but feeling that so important a matter could not be so quickly
settled he went on

oh of course in that case i have nothing to say it is no business
of mine

overton was pulling on his gloves and did not reply

but have you ever thought mr overton what sort of example your
friendship with such a man offered to the community

a very good example i should think

again emmons was confused of christian charity he asked

of an even rarer virtue mr emmonscommonsense and the great man
got into his brougham and drove away




                               chapter x


vickers had heard overtons voice downstairs and would have liked to
explain his reasons for staying and yet they would have been difficult
to define he had come home the evening before fully determined to
go he had dressed and packed and just as he was ready a knock had
come at his door waiting only to hide his bags and to shut up all the
bureaus which the haste of his packing had left open he heard nellie
call to him for an instant he had thought that she had discovered his
intention the next he heard nellie was asking him to go for a doctor

before dawn however a time had come when he might easily have slipped
away unobserved if he had wanted to and yet he had not again
thought of going no one he had said to himself would go away and
leave in such trouble the household that had sheltered him nor was
it only the sense of companionship with nellie that kept him but the
unwonted knowledge that some one depended on and needed him

trained nurses were not to be obtained in hilltop and even if they had
been most of the work of nursing would have devolved on vickers for
mr lee would not let him go out of his sight all that day and most of
the next night vickers sat beside his bed wondering whether the old
mans death was to be the end of the story or the beginning should he
stay or should he go he told himself that overton was right and that
the only decent thing for a wanderer and a fugitive to do was to go
quickly and quietly but the remembrance of emmons poisoned the vision
of his own departure

on the second day of his illness mr lee died for all his devotion
vickers was not with him at the moment the old man had fallen into a
comfortable sleep about noon and nellie had made vickers go and lie
down he was awakened a few hours afterward by the girl herself she
came and sat down beside his sofa and told him gently that his father
had died without waking

my poor child said vickers were you all alone

i have been thinking that i ought to tell you bob she went on
disregarding his interest in her welfare that you have so much more
than made up to my uncle he has been happier than i ever expected
to see him i think that must be a help to you bob and under the
impression that he was suffering a very intimate sorrow she gave him
her hand

vickers took it only for a moment and then replaced it on her lap

they sat in the twilight of the darkened room for some time talking of
plans and arrangements

                                   

the funeral took place on friday and hilltop which had always honored
the name of lee turned out in full force and to increase vickerss
embarrassment every member of the family came to pay the old gentleman
a last token of respect

you must stand near me nellie he said to her the morning of the
funeral and tell me their names

oh you cant have forgotten them bob she answered in the first
place uncle joseph who gave you the goat when you were a little boy
you remember the goat dont you

he merely smiled at her for answer and taking his meaning she
returned quickly

ah not today bob i could not bear to think you would repudiate
your father today then after a moment for he said nothing she
went on of course you remember bertha and jane you used to be so
fond of jane they are coming by the early train they must have left
philadelphia before eight oclock i think that is wholly on your
account bob

subsequently he discovered that they were daughters of a sister of mrs
lees his supposed first cousins

they came some minutes before any one else vickers was alone in
the parlor decorously drawing on a pair of black gloves when they
were ushered in fortunately they were quite unmistakabletwo neat
rustling little black figures followed by a solitary male whose
name proved to be ferdinand looking up vickers greeted them without
hesitation

why jane and bertha he cried

they lifted their veils displaying cheerful and pretty countenances
and to his intense amusement each imprinted a kiss upon his ready
cheek

dear bob said one of them we are so sorry for you and yet how
glad you must have been to be at home when it happened poor uncle
robert we havent seen him for years

sam was so dreadfully sorry he could not come said the other with a
manner so frankly disingenuous that vickers could not resist answering

aye i suppose so

not in the least abashed the little lady smiled back

well it is strange she admitted that he always has a toothache
when it is a question of a family funeral he keeps one tooth
especially i believe and feeling that more friendly relations were
now established she continued how tall you are bob were you
always as tall as that you look sad poor boy why dont you come down
after the ceremony and stay a few weeks with us and let us try to
console you

thank you said vickers but i shall have to be here until
tomorrow

oh i see nellie will need you but you might ask her nellie she
added we want bob to come with us after the funeral he seems to
think you cant spare him

nellie who had just entered the room looked for an instant somewhat
confused by this sudden address but almost at once she replied coldly
that she had spared bob for so many years that she could probably do it
again

without very much encouragement the two new cousins continued to cling
to vickers throughout the remainder of the ceremonies they looked upon
him as a direct reward of virtue they had risen at an impossibly
early hour given up engagements merely from a sense of obligation to
an old gentleman they hardly knew the discovery of a goodlooking
cousin was a returnno more than just but utterly unexpected

for his part if he had not been very conscious that this was his last
day with nellie he would have enjoyed the company of the others he
took them down to the station and put them on their train though he
continued to refuse to accompany them

but youll come some day soon wont you bob bertha exclaimed i
hear you are very wicked but it doesnt matter

yes said vickers i myself understand that i am an excellent
subject for reform

we wont try and reform you they answered we like you as you are
and they kissed him again and departed

on his return to the house he heard that nellie had gone to lie down
leaving word that mr overton was coming after lunch overton had been
mr lees man of business he and emmons arrived soon after two they
sat round the library stiffly only overton seemed to be as usual his
calm yankee face untouched by the constraint visible in the others

i dont know whether you want me actually to read the will itself he
said it is a very simple one he leaves all the hilltop property to
his son without restrictions of any kind that is all he had to leave
the town house is nominally nellies but it is mortgaged to its full
value

do you mean to say emmons cried that nellie gets nothing

nothing im sorry to sayperhaps a hundred or so but i doubt even
that

you mean that mr lee did not even leave her the equivalent of the
sum which his son took from her

that is exactly what i mean mr emmons

it is an iniquitous will the man who made that will was mad and no
lawyer should have drawn it for him

i drew it said overton gently

you should not have done so sir replied emmons knowing the facts
as you do you ought to have pointed out to the old man where his
obligations lay

it is the profession of a clergyman not of a lawyer to point out his
clients duty mr emmons

emmons looked from one to the other and then remembering the sudden
friendship that had sprung up between them he asked and when was
this will made

almost three years ago overton answered and there was silence
until seeing emmons about to break out again nellie said mildly

really james if i can bear it i think you might

the sacrifices you made emmons began but she stopped him

blood is thicker than water it would be a pretty poor sort of world
if men did not love their own children better than other peoples

oh if you are satisfied said emmons bitterly and then changed his
sentence but not his tone all i can say is i am glad you all are
pleased

you have not given us much of a chance to say whether we were or not
suggested vickers mildly

emmons turned on him i dont have to ask whether you are satisfied or
not i dont imagine that you have any complaint to make

none at all said vickers

do you mean to tell me that you would take that property emmons
demanded

what are you talking about james said nellie of course bob will
take what his father leaves to him

i shall have my opinion of him if he does

well said vickers if anything could separate me from an
inheritance it would certainly be the fear of mr emmonss criticism

i shall only call your attention to one thing said emmons flushing
slightly does it ever strike you mr bob lee to ask what it was
saved you from criminal prosecution twelve years ago no well ill
tell you respect for your father and the fact that you did not have
any money both of these conditions have changed today

vickers turned to overton as if he had not heard i wonder he said
if we could not talk over family affairs more comfortably if there
were no outsiders present

james is not an outsider said nellie

he is to me said vickers

if he goes i go too nellie answered

in that case said vickers of course he must be allowed to stay
but perhaps you will be so good as to ask him if he must be here not
to interrupt

come come said overton hastily cant we effect some compromise in
this matter as i understand it mr emmons believes that certain sums
are owed miss nellie by you

compromise be damned overton said vickers you know this money is
not mine and i wont touch it

nellie started up the money is yours bob my uncle would never have
pinched and saved to pay me back the money exists only because he
loved you so much it is yours

vickers smiled at her i am glad he said that i do not have to
argue that extremely sophistical point with you the reason that the
money is not mine isi hate to repeat a statement that you asked me
not to make againbut i am not bob lee

he had the satisfaction of seeing that for the first time she weighed
the possibility of the assertions being true

what does he mean mr overton she asked

he means he is not the person he represented himself as being

what is this cried emmons who had remained silent hitherto only
from a species of stupefaction is he trying to make us believe that
his own father did not know him what folly how frivolous

nellies face clouded again evidently to her too it seemed folly
but she said temperately

at least james it will cost him his inheritance if he can make us
believe him he certainly does not gain by the assertion

what cried emmons how can you be so blind he was willing enough
to be bob leehe kept mighty quiet until i threatened suit he was
willing enough to take the money until it looked dangerous and then
we began to hear that he was not the fellow at all

nellie turned desperately to overton

mr overton she said do you believe this story

overton nodded yes he said i do but i must tell you that i have
no proofs of any kind no facts no evidence

then why do you believe it

why indeed murmured emmons with a carefully suppressed laugh a
very good question

i have asked myself why overton answered and i can find only
two reasons if they may be called so first i do feel a difference
between this man and the bob lee i used to knowa difference of
personality and second i have never had any reason to doubt this
mans word

ah but i have said nellie as a boy bob was not truthful

i was not speaking of lee said overton

nellie put her hand to her head oh i dont know what to think she
said and jumped up and walked to the window as if to get away from
emmons who was ready to tell her exactly what to think

she stood there and there was silence in the room overton sat feeling
his chin as if interested in nothing but the closeness of his
mornings shave vickers though his head was bent had fixed his eyes
on nellie and emmons leant back with the manner of the one sane man in
a party of lunatics

nellie was the first to speak turning from the window she asked

if you are not my cousin who are you

my name is lewis vickers

she thought it over a minute and threw out her hands despairingly

oh it is impossible she cried why if you were not my cousin
should you have stayed and worked for us and borne all the hideous
things i said to you only a saint would do such a thing

hell not ask you to believe him a saint put in overton

no i dont even claim to be much of an improvement on lee

oh any one would be an improvement on poor bob

in answer vickers got up and going over to where she stood beside the
window he told her his story he told it ostensibly to her alone but
emmons on the sofa was plainly an interested listener vickers spoke
with that simplicity that directness and absence of any attempt at
selfjustification which the wise use when they are most desirous of
being leniently judged

from the first he began to hope that he was succeeding nellie
regarded him with a clear and steady glance from the start and when he
had finished she remained gazing at himno longer doubtful but with
something almost terrorstricken in her expression

in the pause that followed emmons turned to the lawyer

now you are a clever man mr overton he said easily perhaps you
can explain to me why it is that a fellow who is known to be a thief
and a liar should be in such a hurry to write himself down a murderer
as well

the tone and manner of the interruption coming at a moment of high
emotion were too much for vickerss temper he turned on emmons white
with rage

ive stood about as much as i mean to stand from you he said
overton and nellie are welcome to believe me or not as they like but
you will either believe me or leave this house

his tone was so menacing that overton stood up expecting trouble but
it was nellie who spoke

james will do nothing of the kind she said if you are not bob lee
you have no right to say who shall stay in this house and who shall
not the house is mine and i wont have any one in it who cant be
civil to james

then you certainly cant have me said vickers

it seems not answered nellie

they exchanged such a steellike glance as only those who love each
other can inflict and then vickers flung out of the house

when a few minutes later overton caught up with him his anger had
not cooled

hush hush my dear fellow said the lawyer hilltop is not
accustomed to such language let a spirited lady have her heroics if
she wants




                              chapter xi


left alone with her fianc perhaps nellie expected a word of praise
for her gallant public demonstration in his favor if so she was
disappointed

upon my word he exclaimed as the door shut after vickers i never
in all my life heard such an audacious impostor imagine his daring to
pass himself off as mr lees son throughout an entire month

he told me within twentyfour hours of his arrival that he was not bob
lee and i think he told you too james only you would not believe
him

emmons took no notice of this reply but continued his own train of
thought when i think that for four weeks you have been practically
alone in the house with an escaped murdererfor i dont believe a
word of all this story about false testimonymy blood runs cold and
it is only by the merest chance that we have succeeded in rescuing all
your uncles property from his hands

i think you are wrong james mr vickers never intended to accept my
uncles property

my dear nellie women are so extraordinarily innocent in financial
matters that was the object of his whole plot

i dont think it was a plot it seems to me indeed that we both owe
an apology to mr vickers

an apology said emmons and his color deepened i think you must be
mad nellie i think i owe an apology to the community for having left
him at large so long i ought to have telegraphed to the sheriff of
vickerss crossing at once and i mean to do so without delay

nellie rose to her feet if you do that james she began and then
perhaps remembering that she had been accused of being overfond of
threats in the past she changed her tone you will not do that i am
sure james when you stop to consider that you heard mr vickerss
story only because i insisted on having you present it would be a
breach of confidence to me as well as to him

emmons laughed the law my dear girl he said does not take
cognizance of these fine points it is my duty when i have my hand on
an escaped murderer to close it and i intend to do so he probably
means to leave hilltop tonight and i shall not be able to get a
warrant from vickerss crossing until tomorrow but i can arrange with
the local authorities to arrest him on some trumpedup charge that will
hold him until we get the papers

he moved toward the door to his surprise nellie was there before him

one moment she said i dont think you understand how i feel about
this matter i know mr vickers better than you do whatever he may
have done in the past i feel myself under obligations to him he has
done more than you can even imagine james to make my uncles last
days happy he has been more considerate of me she hesitated and
then went onmore considerate of me in some ways than any one i
have ever met though i have been uniformly insolent and highhanded
with him i admire mr vickers in many respects

it is not ten minutes however since you turned him out of your
house

nellie was silent and then she made a decisive gesture i will not
have you telegraph for that warrant james i let you stay under the
impression that you were an honorable man and i will not have mr
vickers betrayed through my mistake

honor betrayed cried emmons arent we using pretty big words
about the arrest of a common criminal i am very sorry if you
disapprove nellie but i have never yet allowed man or woman to
interfere with what i consider my duty and i dont mean to now let me
pass please

she did not at once move oh ill let you pass james she answered
deliberately only i want you to understand what it means i wont
marry you if you do this i dont know that i could bring myself to
marry you anyhow now

she had the art of irritating her opponent and emmons exclaimed i
dare say you prefer this jailbird to me

she did not reply in words but she moved away from the door and
emmons went out of it the instant he had gone she rang the bell and
when plimpton appeared she said tell the coachman that i want a trap
and the fastest horse of the pair just as quickly as he can get it
tell him to hurry plimpton

plimpton bowed though he did not approve of servants being hurried he
liked orders to be given in time nevertheless he gave her message
and within half an hour she was in mr overtons drawingroom the
great man greeted her warmly

do you know my dear nellie he said almost as he entered i was
just thinking that i ought to have made an appointment to see you
again of course you are in a hurry to get a complete schedule of your
new possessions and to know what you may count on in the future shall
we say tomorrowthat is saturday isnt itabout three

oh there is not the least hurry about that returned nellie and
her manner was unusually agitated any time you like i did not come
about that i came to ask you if you knew where bob ismr vickers i
mean

yes said overton i do

something dreadful has happened nellie went on with less and less
composure i have only just found it out as soon as our interview was
over james emmons told me he meant to telegraph to vickerss crossing
or whatever the name of the place is for a warrant he expects to be
able to arrest mr vickers at once

he does does hethe hound cried overton for the first time losing
his temper he rang a bell and when a servant answered it he ordered
a trap to be ready at once returning to nellie he found that she had
buried her face in her handkerchief and he repented his violence

there there forgive me miss nellie he said i did not mean to
call him a hound i forgot that you were going to marry him

oh dont apologize to me replied nellie with some animation i
wish i had said it myself i am not going to marry him

the news startled overton why is that wise my dear child he said
perhaps neither of us does him justice he is a good steady reliable
man and if i were you i would not go back on him in a hurry

he is not any one of those things said nellie drying her eyes
and looking as dignified as the process allowed he is base he took
advantage of what he heard in confidenceof what he only heard at
all because i made a point of his being there is that reliable or
steady i call it dishonorable and i would rather die than marry such a
creature and so i told him

you know your own business best answered overton but the world is
a sad place for lonely women

it would be a very sad place for both james and me if i married him
feeling as i do said nellie and judging by her expression overton
was inclined to agree with her it was all very well while i could
respect james but now

still ordinary prudence the lawyer began but she interrupted

dont talk to me about ordinary prudence that is what led me into
the awful mistake of being engaged to him at all i thought it would
be wise i used to get thinking about the future and whether i should
have anything to live on

and you dont think of these things now

i dont care sixpence about the future returned nellie and im
sure i dont know why ive been crying except that i am tired and i
think ill go home youll warn mr vickers wont you

i will said overton

nellie still hesitated he is here i suppose

yes he was thinking of staying to dine with me and taking a late
train to town he has a steamer to catch tomorrow but after what you
sayoverton looked at his watchi rather think that he had better
go at once theres a train within half an hour

oh he had much better go at once before james has time to make
trouble she answered and then added gravely mr overton do you
believe that the murder happened just as mr vickers said

do you

yes

so do i overton answered but then i have some reason for i
remember something of the case which was a very celebrated one up the
state and now nellie ill tell you a secret which i wouldnt trust
to any one else i have an impressiona vague one but still i trust
itthat that case was set straight somehow or other if it should
be

telegraph and find out

i wrote some days agothe night before your uncle was taken ill but
i have had no answer but mind dont tell him it would be too cruel
if i should turn out to be wrong

i said nellie i dont ever expect to see the man again

i suppose not he returned and yet i wish it were not too much to
ask you to take him to the station in your trap he wont have more
than time and mine has not come to the door yet

nellie looked as if she were going to refuse but when she spoke she
spoke quite definitely ill take him she said

thank you said overton and left the room

in his library he found vickers standing on the hearthrug though there
was no fire in the chimneyplace his head was bent and he was vaguely
chinking some coins in his pocket

well vickers said his host coolly i have a disagreeable piece of
news for you emmons it seems has telegraphed for a warrant and does
not intend to let you go until he gets it but possibly he wont be
prepared for your slipping away at once theres a train at fiveten
do you care to try it

vickers looked up as if the whole matter were of very small interest
to him there does not seem to be anything else to do does there he
said

of course my offer of a position is still open to you

i cant stay in this country with emmons on my heels theyd lock me
up in a minute

you have never heard anything further about your case have you

not a word there wasnt much to hear i expect i suppose i had
better be going

your bags are at the lees still arent they

and can stay there for all i care ill not put foot in that house
again

i hope you dont feel too resentfully towards miss lee overton
began for in the first place it was she who brought me word of this
move of emmons and in the second

i dont feel resentful at all interrupted vickers but i dont feel
as if i wanted to go out of my way to see her again

and in the second overton went on the only way you can possibly
catch your train now is to let her drive you down she has a trap
outside and she seemed to be

he paused for the door had slammed behind vickers and when he
followed the two were already in the trap overton smiled

thats right he said make haste but you might at least say
goodby to a man you may never see again goodby my dear fellow good
luck

vickers a little ashamed shook hands with the older man in silence
and overton went on whatever happens vickers do not resist arrest
i have ordered a trap and ill follow you as soon as it comes not that
i anticipate any trouble

they drove away and overton as he entered the house murmured to
himself not that they listened to a word i said

yet if they had not listened it did not seem to be from any desire to
talk themselves they drove out of the gates in silence and had gone
some distance before nellie asked

where shall you go tonight mr vickers

thank you for your interest returned vickers bitterly but it
seems that my plans have been quite sufficiently spread about hilltop
perhaps it would be as well for me not to answer your question i am
going away

not unnaturally this speech angered nellie you do not seem to
understand she said that i came to warn you that you must go

i was going anyhow he retorted but of course i am very much
obliged to you for any trouble you may have taken

i thought it my duty she began but he interrupted her with a laugh

your duty of course you never do anything from any other motive
that is exactly why i do not tell you my plans you might feel it your
duty to repeat them to emmons i think i remember your saying that you
always tell him everything

you are making it said nellie in a voice as cool as his own
rather difficult for me to say what i think is due to youand that is
that i owe you an apology for having insisted yesterday

you owe me so many apologies returned vickers that you will hardly
have time to make them between here and the station so perhaps it is
hardly worth while to begin

you have a right to take this tone with me said nellie acutely
aware how often she had taken it with him but you shall not keep me
from saying mr vickers that i am very conscious of how ill i have
treated you and that your patience has given me a respect for you
she stopped for vickers laughed contemptuously but as he said nothing
in answer she presently went on again i do not know what it is that
strikes you as ludicrous in what i am saying i was going to add that i
should like to hear now and then how you are getting on if it is not
too much to ask

he turned on her you mean you want me to write to you

she nodded

i am afraid your future husband would not approve of the
correspondence and as you tell him everythingno i had far better
risk it now and tell you my plans at once i am going to south
america where i am going to be a real live general over a small but
excellent little army i know for i made some of it myself

and will you be safe there

yes if you mean from emmons and the process of the law on the
other hand some people do not consider soldiering the very safest
of professionsespecially in those countries where they sometimes
really fight and contrary to the popular notion when they do fight
it is very much the real thing fancy your feelings nellie when some
day you read in the papers the one irreparable loss to the liberal
party was the death of general don luis vickers who died at the head
of his column ah i should die happy if only i could die with
sufficient glory to induce emmons to refer to me in public as an odd
sort of fellow a cousin of my wifes i can hear him my spirit would
return to gloat

he will never say that said nellie with a meaning which vickers
unhappily lost

ah you cant tell nellie general luis vickers sounds so much
better than vickers the man the police want and emmonss standards
i notice depend almost entirely on what people say nellie he went
on suddenly i have something to say to you you and i are never
going to see each other again and heaven knows i dont want to write
to you or hear from you again this is all there will ever be and
i am going to offer you a piece of advice as if i were going to die
tomorrow dont marry emmons he is not the right sort perhaps you
think i have no right to criticise a man who has always kept a good
deal straighter than i but it is just because i have knocked about
that i know he wont do you are independent now your farm will bring
you in something keep the fellow i put in there and sell a few of the
upland lots you wont be rich but youll be comfortable dont marry
emmons

why do you say this to me

because i know its the right thing to say i can say anything to
you as far as a woman like you is concerned i realize a man like
myselfwithout a cent without even a decent namedoesnt exist at
all not even emmons himself could suppose that in advising you not to
marry him i have any hope for myself

and yet that is just what he does think she forced herself to look
at him and her look had the anxious temerity of a child who has just
defied its elders

nellie what do you mean

i am not going to marry mr emmons

you are not you are not oh my darling what a place the world
is have i really lost you

nellie smiled at him without turning her head i thought you had no
hope

he had no sense of decency for he kissed her twice on the public
highway i havent he answered i cant stay and you cant go with
me imagine you in the tropics

i certainly cant go if im not asked

think what you are saying to me woman he answered in another
moment i shall ask you if you love me and then

she turned to him and put her hand in his suppose you do ask me
she said

vickers held it and bent his head over it and laid it against his
mouth but he shook his head no he said i wont i have just one
or two remnants of decency left and i wont do that

he stopped for nellie had turned the horse down an unexpected road
where are you going he said

back to the house you cant sail without your things

my dear girl ive spent half my life traveling without my things

well you arent going to do it any more she answered and her tone
had so domestic a flavor that he kissed her again

plimpton met them in the hall and nellie lost no time

pack mr vickerss things at once please she said and would have
passed on but she was arrested by plimptons voice

whose madam he asked like many men of parts he believed that to
be puzzled and to be insulted are much the same thing

mine plimpton mine said vickers and just for once leave out as
much of the tissue paper and cotton wool as possible ive a train to
catch

and tell my maid to pack something for meas much as she can get into
a valise and tea at once plimpton

plimpton did not say that he totally disapproved of the whole plan but
his tone was very cold as he said that tea was already served in the
drawingroom

goodness only knows when we shall see food again nellie remarked as
she sat down behind the teakettle

i can hardly catch my train nellie

no matter we can drive over to the other linenine or ten miles

it will be rather a long lonely journey back wont it

for the horse you mean said nellie well to tell the truth i
dont exactly know how the horse is going to get back and i dont much
care

nellie said vickers and he laid his hand on her shoulder with a
gesture that was almost paternal i cant let you do this you have no
idea what a life it would bewhat it would mean to be the wife of a
man who

i shall know very soon returned she irrepressibly but i have some
idea what a life it would be to be left behind and so i am afraid you
must put this newlyfound prudence of yours in your pocket and make up
your mind

but she did not finish a sentence whose end was fairly obvious for
the door was thrown open in plimptons best manner and emmons entered
he stopped on seeing vickers and stared at him with round eyes

you he cried this is the last place i should have thought of
looking for you

but does not a meeting like this make amends vickers began lightly
but nellie struck a better note with her cool i should think this
would have been the most natural place to look tea james

no thank you replied emmons sternly ive no time for tea just
now i parted from the sheriff not ten minutes ago and i must go and
find him at once

sorry you wont stay and have a chat said vickers but doubtless
you know best

youll find out what i know within half an hour said emmons and
left the room slamming the door behind him

james is developing quite a taste for repartee observed vickers

nellie rose put out the light under the kettle and began to draw on
her gloves we must start now she said

now or never said vickers

they were halfway down the drive before nellie asked in the most
matteroffact tone are the bags in

he nodded

mine too

yours too nellie weakkneed that i am when i felt it in my hand i
said a brave man would leave this one behind buti put it in

catching his eye she smiled that was very kind of you she said
for i you know have not spent half my life traveling without my
things
